(b)         All computations of interest and of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.   (c)         Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest.      38       (d)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.   (e)         The Loan Parties’ obligation to pay all amounts due hereunder and under any other Loan Documents shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including:   (i)         any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, deduction, abatement, suspension, diminution, reduction, defense or other right which any Loan Party may have against any supplier, whether such supplier was paid from the proceeds of Loans or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever arising under or pursuant to any supply agreement or otherwise relating to the purchase of goods, other property or services from or by any such supplier;   (ii)         any defect in the condition, design, operation, or fitness for use of, or any damage to or loss or destruction of, any equipment or material provided by any such supplier;   (iii)         any actual or alleged default by any such supplier or any other Person under any supply agreement; or   (iv)         any other fact or circumstance relating to any supply agreement.

If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender      39       or the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made all required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all such deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.   (b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or future stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a security interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).   (c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This indemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.   Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from the Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.      40       (d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.

In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

(c)         Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest.      38       (d)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.   (e)         The Loan Parties’ obligation to pay all amounts due hereunder and under any other Loan Documents shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including:   (i)         any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, deduction, abatement, suspension, diminution, reduction, defense or other right which any Loan Party may have against any supplier, whether such supplier was paid from the proceeds of Loans or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever arising under or pursuant to any supply agreement or otherwise relating to the purchase of goods, other property or services from or by any such supplier;   (ii)         any defect in the condition, design, operation, or fitness for use of, or any damage to or loss or destruction of, any equipment or material provided by any such supplier;   (iii)         any actual or alleged default by any such supplier or any other Person under any supply agreement; or   (iv)         any other fact or circumstance relating to any supply agreement.   Section 2.08. Taxes. (a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings or other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender      39       or the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made all required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all such deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.   (b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or future stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a security interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).   (c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This indemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.   Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from the Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.      40       (d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.   (e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)      41    executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update      42       such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.   Section 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.   Section 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it (other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Loans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable (subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of the Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each case immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower will issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each Warrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name.

(c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal amount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue price allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue price and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent jurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.   Section","2.12. Illegality 44":" 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such   44    Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.   Section","2.13. Inability to Determine Rates 45":" 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates.

Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that   45    any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof.

If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

(a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings or other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender      39       or the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made all required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all such deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.   (b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or future stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a security interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).   (c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This indemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.   Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from the Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.      40       (d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.   (e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)      41    executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update      42       such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.   Section 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.   Section 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it (other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Loans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.   Section 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an inducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders its warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to adjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to be substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, or delivered in substitution or exchange for   43       any thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable (subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of the Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each case immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower will issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each Warrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the Closing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder a Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants to be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased by such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such Warrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such notice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants deliverable to such Warrantholder).   (c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal amount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue price allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue price and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent jurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.   Section 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such   44    Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.   Section 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a continuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that   45    any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof.   Section 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:   (i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;   (ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes); or   (iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;   and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case of clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.   (b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender   46    such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.   (c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.   (d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).   Section 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:   (a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);   (b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or   (c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;   excluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.     47    For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Loan was in fact so funded.   Section 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 9.13.   Section 2.17.   Survival.   Each party’s obligations under Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 shall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Loan Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.   Article 3 Representations and Warranties   Representations and Warranties of the Borrower. In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to enter into this Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make the Loans hereunder, the Borrower makes the following representations and warranties as to itself and its Subsidiaries:   Section 3.01.   Existence and Power.   The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to do business in each additional jurisdiction necessary or advisable for the conduct of its business, except for such failures to so qualify in such additional jurisdictions as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to own its Properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower has all requisite organizational power to borrow the Loans and issue the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Lenders and Warrantholders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof.   48       Section 3.02.    Authority.   The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower’s issuance of the Notes to the Lenders and the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Warrantholders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, are within such Person’s organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary organizational action on the part of such Person’s board of directors (or comparable body) and, if necessary such Person’s shareholders, members or partners, as the case may be.   Section 3.03.    Binding Effect.   Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto and each of the Notes and Warrants issued has been validly issued in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto enforceable against such Person in accordance with its respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other laws relative to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally in effect from time to time and by general principles of equity whether applied in equity or at law.   Section 3.04.    Capital Stock; Subsidiaries.   (a) As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, the authorized and issued shares of each class of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a). As of the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to any pre-emptive rights and owned of record and beneficially by the Persons listed on Schedule 3.04(a) free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.   (b)          As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a), neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of Capital Stock of, or have any direct or indirect equity interest in, any other Person.   (c)           Except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(c), as of the Closing Date and after giving effect to the Transactions, there are no securities outstanding that are convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, nor are there outstanding any rights to subscribe for or purchase, or any options or warrants for the purchase of, or any agreements (contingent or otherwise) providing for the issuance of, or any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to, any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower      49       or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares.   (d)          On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase, acquire or retire (i) any of its Capital Stock, (ii) any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any of its Capital Stock, or (iii) any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire any of its Capital Stock.   Section 3.05.   Business Operations and Other Information;   Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Effect. (a) The Borrower has heretofore delivered or caused to be delivered to each Lender copies of the Audited Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements”). The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as otherwise noted therein), consistently applied, and subject, in the case of each of the Financial Statements that are unaudited, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes, and present fairly in all material respects the Consolidated financial position and related Consolidated income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows (as applicable) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at each of the dates and for each of the periods respectively covered thereby.   (b)          As of December 31, 2013, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries had any Indebtedness or liability, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or any Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities, liabilities for material taxes, long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, except as reflected or reserved against on the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements or described in the notes thereto.   (c)          Attached as Schedule 3.05(c) is a copy of the latest (as of the Closing Date) projections of the consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flow of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (assuming consummation of the Transactions) for each of the fiscal years of the Borrower in the period from the Closing Date through 2015, including a detailed cash flow forecast for the 12-month period following the Closing Date. Such projections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on Schedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light of current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future financial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.   50       (d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of the historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then ended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial position and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of business on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date or at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to fairly reflect such assumptions.   (e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or which could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event which individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.   Section 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.    (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.06, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties or rights which, if adversely determined, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b)          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which seek to enjoin, or otherwise prevent the consummation of, the transactions contemplated herein or to recover any damages or obtain any relief as a result of any of the transactions contemplated herein in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority.   (c)          Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will be after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions, as the case may be, in default under or in violation of any Statute or Order, which default or violation, individually or in the aggregate together with all other such defaults and violations has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.07.   No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, issuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or   51    compliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the consummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to the Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the Organizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.   Section 3.08.   Consents, Etc.

(b)          The initial aggregate amount of the Lenders’ Commitment is $45,000,000.   (c)          The Commitments shall terminate on the Closing Date immediately following the funding hereunder.   Section 2.02.  Procedure for Borrowing.  (a) The Borrowing shall be made after irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. The date of the proposed Borrowing shall be a Business Day. Such irrevocable notice of a Borrowing (a “Notice of Borrowing”) shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or facsimile, in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto, specifying therein (i) prior to the Closing Date (x) the requested date of such Borrowing (which date shall be the Closing Date) and (y) the account in which the proceeds of such Borrowing are requested to be deposited with the Borrower   33       and (ii) the Interest Period applicable thereto (with respect to the Borrowing as of the Closing Date and the continuation of a Loan thereafter). Subject to the fulfillment or written waiver of the applicable conditions set forth in Article 4, each Lender shall make available its applicable portion of such Borrowing (determined ratably in accordance with the respective Commitments of the Lenders) in immediately available funds as directed by the Borrower in the Notice of Borrowing.   (b)         The Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of the non-satisfaction for any reason whatsoever on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing of the applicable conditions for the making of any Loans set forth in Article 4, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund such Loan to be made by such Lender as part of the Borrowing requested under such Notice of Borrowing when such Loan, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.   Section 2.03.   Fees.  (a) Commitment Fee.   On the Closing Date, the Borrower shall pay to Athyrium (or to the Administrative Agent for the account of Athyrium), a commitment fee equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of Athyrium’s Commitment.   (b)         Agency Fee.   The Borrower shall pay each Agent an agency fee in the amount set forth in the Agency Fee Letter dated as of the Closing Date between the Borrower and the Agents, payable in advance on the Closing Date and on each anniversary of the Closing Date until the Loans have been repaid in full.   (c)         Prepayment Premium.   The Prepayment Premium shall be payable hereunder in respect of any repayment (other than on the Maturity Date) or prepayment of the Loans (and any repricing or amendment that effectively refinances any Loans hereunder) including any optional or mandatory prepayment under Section 2.05 or following the acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Article 7.   Section 2.04.  Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.  (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Account for the ratable account of the Lenders the outstanding principal amount of the Loans on the Maturity Date.   (b)         Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender   34       resulting from the Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.   (c)         The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.   (d)         The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be binding on the Borrower, absent manifest error; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.   (e)         The Borrower will execute and deliver to each requesting Lender a promissory note of the Borrower in the amount of any Loans owing to such Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit A with appropriate insertions as to date and principal amount (a “Note”). The Borrower irrevocably authorizes each Lender to make or cause to be made an appropriate notation on the Schedule attached to such Lender’s Note of the making of Loans or the receipt of payments, but the failure to record, or any error in so recording, any amount of such Loans or payments on such Schedule shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under any Notes delivered to such Lender to make payments of principal of or interest on the Loans or on such Notes when due.   Section 2.05.   Prepayments.  (a) Optional.  The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time after the Closing Date to prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, upon at least one Business Day’s prior written notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written notice) to the Administrative Agent before 11:00 a.m., New York City time; provided, however, that each partial prepayment shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000. Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of the Loans to be prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the Borrower to prepay such principal amount of the Loans by the amount stated therein on the date stated therein.   (b)         Mandatory.   The Borrower shall prepay the Loans in accordance with the following:   (i)         If any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries Disposes of any Property (including any sale or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any of its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Capital Stock and any sales or issuances of Capital Stock to another Loan Party))      35    (other than any Disposition of any inventory permitted by Section 6.06(a)) which results in the realization by such Person of Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate during the term of this Agreement, the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds no later than two Business Days following receipt thereof by such Person (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clause (iv) below); provided, however, that with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds, at the election of the Borrower (as notified by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds), and so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary may apply such Net Cash Proceeds to reinvest in the purchase of capital assets useful in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary, in each case to be used in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary within 180 days following the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds (or, if within such 180-day period, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary enters into a binding commitment to so reinvest such Net Cash Proceeds, within 360 days following the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds); provided, further, that if within such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period after the date of receipt by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary of such Net Cash Proceeds, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary has not so used all or a portion of such Net Cash Proceeds otherwise required to be applied as a mandatory repayment pursuant to this Section 2.05(b)(i), the remaining portion of such Net Cash Proceeds shall be applied as a mandatory repayment in accordance with the requirements of this Section 2.05(b)(i) on the last day of such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period.   (ii)         Within two Business Days following any Extraordinary Receipt received by or paid to or for the account of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate during the term of this Agreement, and not otherwise included in this Section 2.05(b), the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clause (iv) below); provided, however, that with respect to such Extraordinary Receipts, at the election of the Borrower (as notified by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of receipt of such Extraordinary Receipts), and so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary may apply such Extraordinary Receipts to reinvest in the purchase of assets useful in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary, in each case to be used in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary within 180-days following the date of receipt of such Extraordinary      36       Receipts (or, if within such 180-day period, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary enters into a binding commitment to so reinvest such Extraordinary Receipts, within 360 days following the date of receipt of such Extraordinary Receipts); provided, further, that if within such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period after the date of receipt by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary of such Extraordinary Receipts, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary has not so used all or a portion of such Extraordinary Receipts otherwise required to be applied as a mandatory repayment pursuant to this sentence, the remaining portion of such Extraordinary Receipts shall be applied as a mandatory repayment in accordance with the requirements of this Section 2.05(b)(ii) on the last day of such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period.   (iii)         Upon the incurrence or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness expressly permitted to be incurred or issued pursuant to Section 6.01), the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom no later than two Business Days following receipt thereof by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clauses (iv) and (v) below).   (iv)         Each prepayment of Loans pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05(b) shall be shared among the Lenders ratably.   (c)         All prepayments of Loans under this Section 2.05 (and any repricing or amendment that effectively refinances any Loans hereunder), shall be made in an amount equal to the sum of (x) 100% of the principal amount of such Loans being prepaid (or repriced or effectively refinanced) plus (y) all accrued and unpaid interest on the amount of principal of such Loans being prepaid (or repriced or effectively refinanced) to but excluding the date of such prepayment (or repricing or refinancing) plus (z) the applicable Prepayment Premium. No amounts repaid hereunder may be reborrowed.   Section 2.06.  Interest Rates and Payment Dates.  (a) Except as provided in Section 2.06(b), (x) each LIBOR Rate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from and including the date of such LIBOR Rate Loan to and excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full, at a rate per annum which shall, during each Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period and (y) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from and including the date of such Base Rate Loan to and excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears in cash on each Interest Payment Date.      37    (b)         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default under Section 7.01(a) or Section 7.01(g), the Borrower shall pay interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Loan owing to each Lender, payable in arrears on the dates and in the manner referred to in clause (a) above, and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Loan pursuant to clause (a) above; and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount payable under the Loan Documents that is not paid when due, from the date such amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full, payable in arrears on the date such amount shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum that would be required to be paid at such time in respect of such amounts.   Section 2.07.  Payments and Computations.  (a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 2:00 p.m. on the day when due in U.S. Dollars to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Account, in same day funds, with payments being received by the Administrative Agent after such time being deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.06(d), from and after the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.   (b)         All computations of interest and of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.   (c)         Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest.      38       (d)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.   (e)         The Loan Parties’ obligation to pay all amounts due hereunder and under any other Loan Documents shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including:   (i)         any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, deduction, abatement, suspension, diminution, reduction, defense or other right which any Loan Party may have against any supplier, whether such supplier was paid from the proceeds of Loans or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever arising under or pursuant to any supply agreement or otherwise relating to the purchase of goods, other property or services from or by any such supplier;   (ii)         any defect in the condition, design, operation, or fitness for use of, or any damage to or loss or destruction of, any equipment or material provided by any such supplier;   (iii)         any actual or alleged default by any such supplier or any other Person under any supply agreement; or   (iv)         any other fact or circumstance relating to any supply agreement.   Section 2.08. Taxes. (a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings or other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender      39       or the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made all required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all such deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.   (b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or future stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a security interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).   (c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This indemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.   Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from the Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.      40       (d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.   (e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)      41    executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update      42       such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.   Section 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.   Section 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it (other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Loans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.   Section 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an inducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders its warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to adjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to be substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, or delivered in substitution or exchange for   43       any thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable (subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of the Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each case immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower will issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each Warrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the Closing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder a Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants to be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased by such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such Warrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such notice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants deliverable to such Warrantholder).   (c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal amount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue price allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue price and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent jurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.   Section 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such   44    Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.   Section 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a continuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that   45    any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof.   Section 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:   (i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;   (ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes); or   (iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;   and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case of clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.   (b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender   46    such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.   (c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.   (d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).   Section 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:   (a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);   (b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or   (c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;   excluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.     47    For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Loan was in fact so funded.   Section 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 9.13.   Section 2.17.   Survival.   Each party’s obligations under Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 shall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Loan Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.   Article 3 Representations and Warranties   Representations and Warranties of the Borrower. In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to enter into this Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make the Loans hereunder, the Borrower makes the following representations and warranties as to itself and its Subsidiaries:   Section 3.01.

The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to do business in each additional jurisdiction necessary or advisable for the conduct of its business, except for such failures to so qualify in such additional jurisdictions as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to own its Properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower has all requisite organizational power to borrow the Loans and issue the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Lenders and Warrantholders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof.   48       Section 3.02.    Authority.   The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower’s issuance of the Notes to the Lenders and the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Warrantholders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, are within such Person’s organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary organizational action on the part of such Person’s board of directors (or comparable body) and, if necessary such Person’s shareholders, members or partners, as the case may be.   Section 3.03.    Binding Effect.   Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto and each of the Notes and Warrants issued has been validly issued in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto enforceable against such Person in accordance with its respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other laws relative to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally in effect from time to time and by general principles of equity whether applied in equity or at law.   Section 3.04.    Capital Stock; Subsidiaries.   (a) As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, the authorized and issued shares of each class of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a). As of the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to any pre-emptive rights and owned of record and beneficially by the Persons listed on Schedule 3.04(a) free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.   (b)          As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a), neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of Capital Stock of, or have any direct or indirect equity interest in, any other Person.   (c)           Except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(c), as of the Closing Date and after giving effect to the Transactions, there are no securities outstanding that are convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, nor are there outstanding any rights to subscribe for or purchase, or any options or warrants for the purchase of, or any agreements (contingent or otherwise) providing for the issuance of, or any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to, any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower      49       or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares.   (d)          On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase, acquire or retire (i) any of its Capital Stock, (ii) any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any of its Capital Stock, or (iii) any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire any of its Capital Stock.   Section 3.05.   Business Operations and Other Information;   Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Effect. (a) The Borrower has heretofore delivered or caused to be delivered to each Lender copies of the Audited Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements”). The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as otherwise noted therein), consistently applied, and subject, in the case of each of the Financial Statements that are unaudited, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes, and present fairly in all material respects the Consolidated financial position and related Consolidated income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows (as applicable) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at each of the dates and for each of the periods respectively covered thereby.   (b)          As of December 31, 2013, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries had any Indebtedness or liability, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or any Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities, liabilities for material taxes, long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, except as reflected or reserved against on the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements or described in the notes thereto.   (c)          Attached as Schedule 3.05(c) is a copy of the latest (as of the Closing Date) projections of the consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flow of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (assuming consummation of the Transactions) for each of the fiscal years of the Borrower in the period from the Closing Date through 2015, including a detailed cash flow forecast for the 12-month period following the Closing Date. Such projections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on Schedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light of current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future financial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.   50       (d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of the historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then ended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial position and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of business on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date or at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to fairly reflect such assumptions.   (e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or which could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event which individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.   Section 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.    (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.06, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties or rights which, if adversely determined, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b)          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which seek to enjoin, or otherwise prevent the consummation of, the transactions contemplated herein or to recover any damages or obtain any relief as a result of any of the transactions contemplated herein in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority.   (c)          Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will be after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions, as the case may be, in default under or in violation of any Statute or Order, which default or violation, individually or in the aggregate together with all other such defaults and violations has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.07.   No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, issuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or   51    compliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the consummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to the Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the Organizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.   Section 3.08.   Consents, Etc.   No consent, approval or authorization of or declaration, registration or filing with any Governmental Authority or any nongovernmental Person is required in connection with the execution or delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents or the performance by any such Person of its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or as a condition to the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents, or the consummation of any component of the Transactions, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, registrations or filings as are listed on Schedule 3.08, all of which have been or will on or prior to the Closing Date be obtained or made and are or will then be in full force and effect, and except those which the failure to obtain or make could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.09.    Outstanding Indebtedness.   Schedule 6.01(a) sets forth a correct and complete list and brief description of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness evidenced by the Loans) existing on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, in each case showing the aggregate principal amount thereof (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn commitments with respect thereto), the name of the respective borrower and any other entity which directly or indirectly guarantees such debt and all Liens securing such Indebtedness.   Section 3.10.   Taxes.  The Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, has timely filed all U.S. federal and all material state, local and foreign tax returns, information returns and excise tax returns, forms and reports for Taxes (“Tax Returns”) with the appropriate Governmental Authority which were or are required to have been filed by or on behalf of any such Persons and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and accurately reflect in all material respects all liability for Taxes of the Borrower or Subsidiary taken as a whole for the periods covered thereby. All Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other material Taxes and assessments payable by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof have been timely paid to the appropriate Governmental      52       Authority, unless such Tax liability is being diligently contested in good faith and the Borrower and/or the appropriate Subsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, has adequately reserved against such Tax liability on its books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted with respect to any such Taxes as of the date hereof. No material Tax assessment against the Borrower, or any Subsidiary thereof has been proposed, formally or informally. The Tax liabilities of the Borrower and any Subsidiary thereof are adequately provided for on the relevant Person’s books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP.   Section 3.11.   Disclosure.   None of this Agreement nor any other document or certificate furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith (including the Financial Statements), taken in the aggregate, contained, as of its respective date and as of the Closing Date, and no document or certificate which shall be furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith, when taken as a whole with, all documents and certificates previously delivered, shall contain, as of its date of delivery, any untrue statement of a material fact, or as of any such date omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it being acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary from the projected results. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any facts (other than matters of a general economic or political nature) that individually or in the aggregate have had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.12.    Margin Regulations.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or intends to acquire any “margin stock” as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207). No part of the proceeds of the Loans or the Warrants will be used, and no part of the proceeds of any loans repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the Loans or the Warrants was used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or carrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in a violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220). Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries or any agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or the Loans to violate   53    Regulation U, Regulation X, Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter be in effect. As used in this Section 3.12, the term “purpose of buying or carrying” has the meaning assigned thereto in the aforesaid Regulation U.   Section 3.13.   Pension and Benefit Plans.   (a) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, each of the Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates is in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no Unfunded Pension Liability with respect to any Plans that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b)          Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign Pension Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all requirements of law applicable thereto and the respective requirements of the governing documents for such plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, none of the Borrower, any Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents has engaged in a transaction which would subject the Borrower or any Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to a tax or civil penalty. With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, reserves have been established in the financial statements furnished to Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities in accordance with applicable law and prudent business practice or, where required, in accordance with ordinary accounting practices in the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Pension Plan is maintained. The aggregate unfunded liabilities with respect to Foreign Pension Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect assuming proper funding and administration of such foreign Pension Plans on an ongoing basis.   Section 3.14.     Labor Matters.   As of the date hereof and the Closing Date, there are no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge the Borrower, threatened. The hours worked by and payments made to employees of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters. All payments due from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation      54    on the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.   Section 3.15.   Possession of Franchises, Licenses, Etc.   Each of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries possesses all material franchises, certificates, licenses, permits, registrations, security clearances, designations, approvals and other authorizations from Governmental Authorities that are necessary for the ownership, maintenance and operation of its Properties, and for the conduct of its business as now conducted, and neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any thereof, except for such violations as individually or in the aggregate do not, and could not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.16.   Intellectual Property.   The Borrower and its Subsidiaries own or otherwise possess sufficient rights to all trademarks, service marks, trade names, including all goodwill associated with any of the foregoing, patents, copyrights, domain names, including all registrations and applications for registration of any of the foregoing, inventions, technology, software, know-how (including trade secrets and other unpatented and/or unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures), database rights, rights of privacy and publicity, licenses and other intellectual property and similar rights (collectively, “IP Rights”) used in, held for use in or reasonably necessary for the operation of their respective businesses as currently conducted. Any and all IP Rights owned or purported to be owned by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries are owned solely and exclusively by the Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries, are owned free and clear of all Liens and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, are valid and enforceable. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor the use or sale of any of their products or the provision of any of their services, has materially infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the IP Rights of any Person. No claim, action, suit or proceeding regarding any IP Rights is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.   Section","3.17.

Section","3.20. Ranking of Loans 56":" 3.20.   Ranking of Loans.   The Indebtedness represented by the Loans and the other Loan Obligations under the applicable Loan Documents of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties is intended to constitute senior Indebtedness, and accordingly is, and shall be, at all times while the Loans and the other Loan Obligations remain outstanding senior in right of payment to, or pari passu with, all Indebtedness of the Loan Parties.   Section","3.21. Solvency 56":" 3.21.   Solvency.

(c)         Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest.      38       (d)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

Section 2.08. Taxes. (a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings or other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender      39       or the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made all required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all such deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.   (b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or future stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a security interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).   (c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This indemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.   Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from the Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.      40       (d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.   (e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)      41    executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update      42       such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.   Section 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.   Section 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it (other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Loans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.   Section 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an inducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders its warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to adjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to be substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, or delivered in substitution or exchange for   43       any thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable (subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of the Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each case immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower will issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each Warrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the Closing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder a Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants to be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased by such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such Warrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such notice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants deliverable to such Warrantholder).   (c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal amount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue price allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue price and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent jurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.   Section 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such   44    Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.   Section 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a continuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that   45    any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof.   Section 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:   (i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;   (ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes); or   (iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;   and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case of clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.   (b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender   46    such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.   (c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.   (d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).   Section 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:   (a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);   (b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or   (c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;   excluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.     47    For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Loan was in fact so funded.   Section 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 9.13.   Section 2.17.   Survival.   Each party’s obligations under Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 shall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Loan Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.   Article 3 Representations and Warranties   Representations and Warranties of the Borrower. In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to enter into this Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make the Loans hereunder, the Borrower makes the following representations and warranties as to itself and its Subsidiaries:   Section 3.01.   Existence and Power.   The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to do business in each additional jurisdiction necessary or advisable for the conduct of its business, except for such failures to so qualify in such additional jurisdictions as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to own its Properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower has all requisite organizational power to borrow the Loans and issue the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Lenders and Warrantholders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof.   48       Section 3.02.    Authority.   The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower’s issuance of the Notes to the Lenders and the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Warrantholders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, are within such Person’s organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary organizational action on the part of such Person’s board of directors (or comparable body) and, if necessary such Person’s shareholders, members or partners, as the case may be.   Section 3.03.    Binding Effect.   Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto and each of the Notes and Warrants issued has been validly issued in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto enforceable against such Person in accordance with its respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other laws relative to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally in effect from time to time and by general principles of equity whether applied in equity or at law.   Section 3.04.    Capital Stock; Subsidiaries.   (a) As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, the authorized and issued shares of each class of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a). As of the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to any pre-emptive rights and owned of record and beneficially by the Persons listed on Schedule 3.04(a) free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.   (b)          As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a), neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of Capital Stock of, or have any direct or indirect equity interest in, any other Person.   (c)           Except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(c), as of the Closing Date and after giving effect to the Transactions, there are no securities outstanding that are convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, nor are there outstanding any rights to subscribe for or purchase, or any options or warrants for the purchase of, or any agreements (contingent or otherwise) providing for the issuance of, or any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to, any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower      49       or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares.   (d)          On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase, acquire or retire (i) any of its Capital Stock, (ii) any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any of its Capital Stock, or (iii) any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire any of its Capital Stock.   Section 3.05.   Business Operations and Other Information;   Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Effect. (a) The Borrower has heretofore delivered or caused to be delivered to each Lender copies of the Audited Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements”). The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as otherwise noted therein), consistently applied, and subject, in the case of each of the Financial Statements that are unaudited, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes, and present fairly in all material respects the Consolidated financial position and related Consolidated income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows (as applicable) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at each of the dates and for each of the periods respectively covered thereby.   (b)          As of December 31, 2013, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries had any Indebtedness or liability, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or any Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities, liabilities for material taxes, long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, except as reflected or reserved against on the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements or described in the notes thereto.   (c)          Attached as Schedule 3.05(c) is a copy of the latest (as of the Closing Date) projections of the consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flow of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (assuming consummation of the Transactions) for each of the fiscal years of the Borrower in the period from the Closing Date through 2015, including a detailed cash flow forecast for the 12-month period following the Closing Date. Such projections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on Schedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light of current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future financial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.   50       (d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of the historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then ended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial position and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of business on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date or at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to fairly reflect such assumptions.   (e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or which could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event which individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.   Section 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.    (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.06, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties or rights which, if adversely determined, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b)          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which seek to enjoin, or otherwise prevent the consummation of, the transactions contemplated herein or to recover any damages or obtain any relief as a result of any of the transactions contemplated herein in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority.   (c)          Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will be after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions, as the case may be, in default under or in violation of any Statute or Order, which default or violation, individually or in the aggregate together with all other such defaults and violations has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.07.   No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, issuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or   51    compliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the consummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to the Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the Organizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.   Section 3.08.   Consents, Etc.   No consent, approval or authorization of or declaration, registration or filing with any Governmental Authority or any nongovernmental Person is required in connection with the execution or delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents or the performance by any such Person of its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or as a condition to the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents, or the consummation of any component of the Transactions, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, registrations or filings as are listed on Schedule 3.08, all of which have been or will on or prior to the Closing Date be obtained or made and are or will then be in full force and effect, and except those which the failure to obtain or make could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.09.    Outstanding Indebtedness.   Schedule 6.01(a) sets forth a correct and complete list and brief description of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness evidenced by the Loans) existing on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, in each case showing the aggregate principal amount thereof (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn commitments with respect thereto), the name of the respective borrower and any other entity which directly or indirectly guarantees such debt and all Liens securing such Indebtedness.   Section 3.10.   Taxes.  The Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, has timely filed all U.S. federal and all material state, local and foreign tax returns, information returns and excise tax returns, forms and reports for Taxes (“Tax Returns”) with the appropriate Governmental Authority which were or are required to have been filed by or on behalf of any such Persons and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and accurately reflect in all material respects all liability for Taxes of the Borrower or Subsidiary taken as a whole for the periods covered thereby. All Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other material Taxes and assessments payable by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof have been timely paid to the appropriate Governmental      52       Authority, unless such Tax liability is being diligently contested in good faith and the Borrower and/or the appropriate Subsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, has adequately reserved against such Tax liability on its books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted with respect to any such Taxes as of the date hereof. No material Tax assessment against the Borrower, or any Subsidiary thereof has been proposed, formally or informally.

(b)          The initial aggregate amount of the Lenders’ Commitment is $45,000,000.   (c)          The Commitments shall terminate on the Closing Date immediately following the funding hereunder.   Section 2.02.  Procedure for Borrowing.  (a) The Borrowing shall be made after irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. The date of the proposed Borrowing shall be a Business Day. Such irrevocable notice of a Borrowing (a “Notice of Borrowing”) shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or facsimile, in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto, specifying therein (i) prior to the Closing Date (x) the requested date of such Borrowing (which date shall be the Closing Date) and (y) the account in which the proceeds of such Borrowing are requested to be deposited with the Borrower   33       and (ii) the Interest Period applicable thereto (with respect to the Borrowing as of the Closing Date and the continuation of a Loan thereafter). Subject to the fulfillment or written waiver of the applicable conditions set forth in Article 4, each Lender shall make available its applicable portion of such Borrowing (determined ratably in accordance with the respective Commitments of the Lenders) in immediately available funds as directed by the Borrower in the Notice of Borrowing.   (b)         The Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of the non-satisfaction for any reason whatsoever on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing of the applicable conditions for the making of any Loans set forth in Article 4, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund such Loan to be made by such Lender as part of the Borrowing requested under such Notice of Borrowing when such Loan, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.   Section 2.03.   Fees.  (a) Commitment Fee.   On the Closing Date, the Borrower shall pay to Athyrium (or to the Administrative Agent for the account of Athyrium), a commitment fee equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of Athyrium’s Commitment.   (b)         Agency Fee.   The Borrower shall pay each Agent an agency fee in the amount set forth in the Agency Fee Letter dated as of the Closing Date between the Borrower and the Agents, payable in advance on the Closing Date and on each anniversary of the Closing Date until the Loans have been repaid in full.   (c)         Prepayment Premium.   The Prepayment Premium shall be payable hereunder in respect of any repayment (other than on the Maturity Date) or prepayment of the Loans (and any repricing or amendment that effectively refinances any Loans hereunder) including any optional or mandatory prepayment under Section 2.05 or following the acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Article 7.   Section 2.04.  Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.  (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Account for the ratable account of the Lenders the outstanding principal amount of the Loans on the Maturity Date.   (b)         Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender   34       resulting from the Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.   (c)         The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.   (d)         The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be binding on the Borrower, absent manifest error; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.   (e)         The Borrower will execute and deliver to each requesting Lender a promissory note of the Borrower in the amount of any Loans owing to such Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit A with appropriate insertions as to date and principal amount (a “Note”). The Borrower irrevocably authorizes each Lender to make or cause to be made an appropriate notation on the Schedule attached to such Lender’s Note of the making of Loans or the receipt of payments, but the failure to record, or any error in so recording, any amount of such Loans or payments on such Schedule shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under any Notes delivered to such Lender to make payments of principal of or interest on the Loans or on such Notes when due.   Section 2.05.   Prepayments.  (a) Optional.  The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time after the Closing Date to prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, upon at least one Business Day’s prior written notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written notice) to the Administrative Agent before 11:00 a.m., New York City time; provided, however, that each partial prepayment shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000. Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of the Loans to be prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the Borrower to prepay such principal amount of the Loans by the amount stated therein on the date stated therein.   (b)         Mandatory.   The Borrower shall prepay the Loans in accordance with the following:   (i)         If any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries Disposes of any Property (including any sale or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any of its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Capital Stock and any sales or issuances of Capital Stock to another Loan Party))      35    (other than any Disposition of any inventory permitted by Section 6.06(a)) which results in the realization by such Person of Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate during the term of this Agreement, the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds no later than two Business Days following receipt thereof by such Person (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clause (iv) below); provided, however, that with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds, at the election of the Borrower (as notified by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds), and so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary may apply such Net Cash Proceeds to reinvest in the purchase of capital assets useful in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary, in each case to be used in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary within 180 days following the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds (or, if within such 180-day period, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary enters into a binding commitment to so reinvest such Net Cash Proceeds, within 360 days following the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds); provided, further, that if within such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period after the date of receipt by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary of such Net Cash Proceeds, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary has not so used all or a portion of such Net Cash Proceeds otherwise required to be applied as a mandatory repayment pursuant to this Section 2.05(b)(i), the remaining portion of such Net Cash Proceeds shall be applied as a mandatory repayment in accordance with the requirements of this Section 2.05(b)(i) on the last day of such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period.   (ii)         Within two Business Days following any Extraordinary Receipt received by or paid to or for the account of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate during the term of this Agreement, and not otherwise included in this Section 2.05(b), the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clause (iv) below); provided, however, that with respect to such Extraordinary Receipts, at the election of the Borrower (as notified by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of receipt of such Extraordinary Receipts), and so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary may apply such Extraordinary Receipts to reinvest in the purchase of assets useful in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary, in each case to be used in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary within 180-days following the date of receipt of such Extraordinary      36       Receipts (or, if within such 180-day period, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary enters into a binding commitment to so reinvest such Extraordinary Receipts, within 360 days following the date of receipt of such Extraordinary Receipts); provided, further, that if within such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period after the date of receipt by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary of such Extraordinary Receipts, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary has not so used all or a portion of such Extraordinary Receipts otherwise required to be applied as a mandatory repayment pursuant to this sentence, the remaining portion of such Extraordinary Receipts shall be applied as a mandatory repayment in accordance with the requirements of this Section 2.05(b)(ii) on the last day of such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period.   (iii)         Upon the incurrence or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness expressly permitted to be incurred or issued pursuant to Section 6.01), the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom no later than two Business Days following receipt thereof by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clauses (iv) and (v) below).   (iv)         Each prepayment of Loans pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05(b) shall be shared among the Lenders ratably.   (c)         All prepayments of Loans under this Section 2.05 (and any repricing or amendment that effectively refinances any Loans hereunder), shall be made in an amount equal to the sum of (x) 100% of the principal amount of such Loans being prepaid (or repriced or effectively refinanced) plus (y) all accrued and unpaid interest on the amount of principal of such Loans being prepaid (or repriced or effectively refinanced) to but excluding the date of such prepayment (or repricing or refinancing) plus (z) the applicable Prepayment Premium. No amounts repaid hereunder may be reborrowed.   Section 2.06.  Interest Rates and Payment Dates.  (a) Except as provided in Section 2.06(b), (x) each LIBOR Rate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from and including the date of such LIBOR Rate Loan to and excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full, at a rate per annum which shall, during each Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period and (y) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from and including the date of such Base Rate Loan to and excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears in cash on each Interest Payment Date.      37    (b)         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default under Section 7.01(a) or Section 7.01(g), the Borrower shall pay interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Loan owing to each Lender, payable in arrears on the dates and in the manner referred to in clause (a) above, and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Loan pursuant to clause (a) above; and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount payable under the Loan Documents that is not paid when due, from the date such amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full, payable in arrears on the date such amount shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum that would be required to be paid at such time in respect of such amounts.   Section 2.07.  Payments and Computations.  (a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 2:00 p.m. on the day when due in U.S. Dollars to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Account, in same day funds, with payments being received by the Administrative Agent after such time being deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.06(d), from and after the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.   (b)         All computations of interest and of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.   (c)         Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest.      38       (d)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.   (e)         The Loan Parties’ obligation to pay all amounts due hereunder and under any other Loan Documents shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including:   (i)         any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, deduction, abatement, suspension, diminution, reduction, defense or other right which any Loan Party may have against any supplier, whether such supplier was paid from the proceeds of Loans or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever arising under or pursuant to any supply agreement or otherwise relating to the purchase of goods, other property or services from or by any such supplier;   (ii)         any defect in the condition, design, operation, or fitness for use of, or any damage to or loss or destruction of, any equipment or material provided by any such supplier;   (iii)         any actual or alleged default by any such supplier or any other Person under any supply agreement; or   (iv)         any other fact or circumstance relating to any supply agreement.   Section 2.08. Taxes. (a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings or other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender      39       or the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made all required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all such deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.   (b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or future stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a security interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).   (c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This indemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.   Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from the Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.      40       (d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.   (e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)      41    executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update      42       such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.   Section 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.   Section 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it (other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Loans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.   Section 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an inducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders its warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to adjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to be substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, or delivered in substitution or exchange for   43       any thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable (subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of the Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each case immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower will issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each Warrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the Closing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder a Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants to be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased by such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such Warrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such notice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants deliverable to such Warrantholder).   (c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal amount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue price allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue price and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent jurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.   Section 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such   44    Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.   Section 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a continuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that   45    any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof.   Section 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:   (i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;   (ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes); or   (iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;   and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case of clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.   (b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender   46    such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.   (c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.   (d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).   Section 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:   (a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);   (b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or   (c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;   excluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.     47    For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Loan was in fact so funded.   Section 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 9.13.   Section 2.17.   Survival.   Each party’s obligations under Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 shall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Loan Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.   Article 3 Representations and Warranties   Representations and Warranties of the Borrower. In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to enter into this Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make the Loans hereunder, the Borrower makes the following representations and warranties as to itself and its Subsidiaries:   Section 3.01.   Existence and Power.   The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to do business in each additional jurisdiction necessary or advisable for the conduct of its business, except for such failures to so qualify in such additional jurisdictions as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to own its Properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower has all requisite organizational power to borrow the Loans and issue the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Lenders and Warrantholders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof.   48       Section 3.02.    Authority.   The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower’s issuance of the Notes to the Lenders and the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Warrantholders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, are within such Person’s organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary organizational action on the part of such Person’s board of directors (or comparable body) and, if necessary such Person’s shareholders, members or partners, as the case may be.   Section 3.03.    Binding Effect.   Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto and each of the Notes and Warrants issued has been validly issued in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto enforceable against such Person in accordance with its respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other laws relative to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally in effect from time to time and by general principles of equity whether applied in equity or at law.   Section 3.04.    Capital Stock; Subsidiaries.   (a) As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, the authorized and issued shares of each class of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a). As of the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to any pre-emptive rights and owned of record and beneficially by the Persons listed on Schedule 3.04(a) free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.   (b)          As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a), neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of Capital Stock of, or have any direct or indirect equity interest in, any other Person.   (c)           Except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(c), as of the Closing Date and after giving effect to the Transactions, there are no securities outstanding that are convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, nor are there outstanding any rights to subscribe for or purchase, or any options or warrants for the purchase of, or any agreements (contingent or otherwise) providing for the issuance of, or any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to, any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower      49       or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares.   (d)          On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase, acquire or retire (i) any of its Capital Stock, (ii) any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any of its Capital Stock, or (iii) any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire any of its Capital Stock.   Section 3.05.   Business Operations and Other Information;   Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Effect. (a) The Borrower has heretofore delivered or caused to be delivered to each Lender copies of the Audited Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements”). The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as otherwise noted therein), consistently applied, and subject, in the case of each of the Financial Statements that are unaudited, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes, and present fairly in all material respects the Consolidated financial position and related Consolidated income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows (as applicable) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at each of the dates and for each of the periods respectively covered thereby.   (b)          As of December 31, 2013, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries had any Indebtedness or liability, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or any Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities, liabilities for material taxes, long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, except as reflected or reserved against on the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements or described in the notes thereto.   (c)          Attached as Schedule 3.05(c) is a copy of the latest (as of the Closing Date) projections of the consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flow of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (assuming consummation of the Transactions) for each of the fiscal years of the Borrower in the period from the Closing Date through 2015, including a detailed cash flow forecast for the 12-month period following the Closing Date. Such projections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on Schedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light of current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future financial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.   50       (d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of the historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then ended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial position and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of business on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date or at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to fairly reflect such assumptions.   (e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or which could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event which individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.   Section 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.    (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.06, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties or rights which, if adversely determined, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b)          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which seek to enjoin, or otherwise prevent the consummation of, the transactions contemplated herein or to recover any damages or obtain any relief as a result of any of the transactions contemplated herein in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority.   (c)          Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will be after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions, as the case may be, in default under or in violation of any Statute or Order, which default or violation, individually or in the aggregate together with all other such defaults and violations has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.07.   No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, issuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or   51    compliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the consummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to the Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the Organizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.   Section 3.08.   Consents, Etc.   No consent, approval or authorization of or declaration, registration or filing with any Governmental Authority or any nongovernmental Person is required in connection with the execution or delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents or the performance by any such Person of its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or as a condition to the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents, or the consummation of any component of the Transactions, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, registrations or filings as are listed on Schedule 3.08, all of which have been or will on or prior to the Closing Date be obtained or made and are or will then be in full force and effect, and except those which the failure to obtain or make could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.09.    Outstanding Indebtedness.   Schedule 6.01(a) sets forth a correct and complete list and brief description of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness evidenced by the Loans) existing on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, in each case showing the aggregate principal amount thereof (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn commitments with respect thereto), the name of the respective borrower and any other entity which directly or indirectly guarantees such debt and all Liens securing such Indebtedness.   Section 3.10.   Taxes.  The Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, has timely filed all U.S. federal and all material state, local and foreign tax returns, information returns and excise tax returns, forms and reports for Taxes (“Tax Returns”) with the appropriate Governmental Authority which were or are required to have been filed by or on behalf of any such Persons and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and accurately reflect in all material respects all liability for Taxes of the Borrower or Subsidiary taken as a whole for the periods covered thereby. All Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other material Taxes and assessments payable by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof have been timely paid to the appropriate Governmental      52       Authority, unless such Tax liability is being diligently contested in good faith and the Borrower and/or the appropriate Subsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, has adequately reserved against such Tax liability on its books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted with respect to any such Taxes as of the date hereof. No material Tax assessment against the Borrower, or any Subsidiary thereof has been proposed, formally or informally. The Tax liabilities of the Borrower and any Subsidiary thereof are adequately provided for on the relevant Person’s books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP.   Section 3.11.   Disclosure.   None of this Agreement nor any other document or certificate furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith (including the Financial Statements), taken in the aggregate, contained, as of its respective date and as of the Closing Date, and no document or certificate which shall be furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith, when taken as a whole with, all documents and certificates previously delivered, shall contain, as of its date of delivery, any untrue statement of a material fact, or as of any such date omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it being acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary from the projected results. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any facts (other than matters of a general economic or political nature) that individually or in the aggregate have had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.12.    Margin Regulations.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or intends to acquire any “margin stock” as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207). No part of the proceeds of the Loans or the Warrants will be used, and no part of the proceeds of any loans repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the Loans or the Warrants was used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or carrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in a violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220). Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries or any agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or the Loans to violate   53    Regulation U, Regulation X, Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter be in effect. As used in this Section 3.12, the term “purpose of buying or carrying” has the meaning assigned thereto in the aforesaid Regulation U.   Section 3.13.   Pension and Benefit Plans.   (a) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, each of the Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates is in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no Unfunded Pension Liability with respect to any Plans that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b)          Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign Pension Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all requirements of law applicable thereto and the respective requirements of the governing documents for such plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, none of the Borrower, any Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents has engaged in a transaction which would subject the Borrower or any Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to a tax or civil penalty. With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, reserves have been established in the financial statements furnished to Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities in accordance with applicable law and prudent business practice or, where required, in accordance with ordinary accounting practices in the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Pension Plan is maintained. The aggregate unfunded liabilities with respect to Foreign Pension Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect assuming proper funding and administration of such foreign Pension Plans on an ongoing basis.   Section 3.14.     Labor Matters.   As of the date hereof and the Closing Date, there are no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge the Borrower, threatened. The hours worked by and payments made to employees of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters. All payments due from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation      54    on the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.   Section 3.15.   Possession of Franchises, Licenses, Etc.   Each of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries possesses all material franchises, certificates, licenses, permits, registrations, security clearances, designations, approvals and other authorizations from Governmental Authorities that are necessary for the ownership, maintenance and operation of its Properties, and for the conduct of its business as now conducted, and neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any thereof, except for such violations as individually or in the aggregate do not, and could not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.16.   Intellectual Property.   The Borrower and its Subsidiaries own or otherwise possess sufficient rights to all trademarks, service marks, trade names, including all goodwill associated with any of the foregoing, patents, copyrights, domain names, including all registrations and applications for registration of any of the foregoing, inventions, technology, software, know-how (including trade secrets and other unpatented and/or unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures), database rights, rights of privacy and publicity, licenses and other intellectual property and similar rights (collectively, “IP Rights”) used in, held for use in or reasonably necessary for the operation of their respective businesses as currently conducted. Any and all IP Rights owned or purported to be owned by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries are owned solely and exclusively by the Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries, are owned free and clear of all Liens and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, are valid and enforceable. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor the use or sale of any of their products or the provision of any of their services, has materially infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the IP Rights of any Person. No claim, action, suit or proceeding regarding any IP Rights is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.   Section 3.17.   Use of Proceeds.   The proceeds from the Loans and the Warrants shall be used by the Borrower (i) to prepay in full the Manchester Seller Financing, (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions and (iii) for general corporate purposes consistent with the terms hereof.   Section 3.18.   OFAC; Anti-Corruption Laws.   Neither the Borrower, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, any director, officer, employee, agent, affiliate or representative thereof, is an individual or entity that is, or is owned or controlled by any individual or entity that is (i) currently the subject or target of any Sanctions or (ii) located, organized or resident in a Designated Jurisdiction. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have   55    conducted their businesses in compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws and have instituted and maintained policies and procedures designed to promote and achieve compliance with such laws.   Section 3.19.   Status under Certain Laws.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is an “investment company” or a “person directly or indirectly controlled by or acting on behalf of an investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.   Section 3.20.   Ranking of Loans.   The Indebtedness represented by the Loans and the other Loan Obligations under the applicable Loan Documents of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties is intended to constitute senior Indebtedness, and accordingly is, and shall be, at all times while the Loans and the other Loan Obligations remain outstanding senior in right of payment to, or pari passu with, all Indebtedness of the Loan Parties.   Section 3.21.   Solvency.   The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are Solvent on the Closing Date both before and after giving effect to the Transactions to be effected on the Closing Date and the application of the net proceeds of the Loans and the Warrants.   Section 3.22.     Restrictions on or Relating to Subsidiaries.   There does not exist any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of (x) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock or any other interest or participation in its profits owned by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, or to pay any Indebtedness owed to the Borrower or a Subsidiary thereof, (y) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to make loans or advances to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof or (z) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to transfer any of its properties or assets to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, except for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of (i) applicable law, (ii) the Loan Documents with respect to clause (z) only, Liens permitted to exist pursuant to Section 6.02 and (iii) with respect to clause (z) only, customary restrictions on assignment, subletting or transfer in any lease, license or contract. Except for customary provisions of corporate law regarding payment of Restricted Payments and exchange control requirements generally applicable to transfers of foreign currency, no Subsidiary of the Borrower is subject to any law which limits the amount or timing of the repatriation of profits or the payment of dividends to foreign shareholders.

(b)         Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender   34       resulting from the Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.   (c)         The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.   (d)         The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be binding on the Borrower, absent manifest error; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.   (e)         The Borrower will execute and deliver to each requesting Lender a promissory note of the Borrower in the amount of any Loans owing to such Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit A with appropriate insertions as to date and principal amount (a “Note”). The Borrower irrevocably authorizes each Lender to make or cause to be made an appropriate notation on the Schedule attached to such Lender’s Note of the making of Loans or the receipt of payments, but the failure to record, or any error in so recording, any amount of such Loans or payments on such Schedule shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under any Notes delivered to such Lender to make payments of principal of or interest on the Loans or on such Notes when due.   Section 2.05.   Prepayments.  (a) Optional.  The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time after the Closing Date to prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, upon at least one Business Day’s prior written notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written notice) to the Administrative Agent before 11:00 a.m., New York City time; provided, however, that each partial prepayment shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000. Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of the Loans to be prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the Borrower to prepay such principal amount of the Loans by the amount stated therein on the date stated therein.   (b)         Mandatory.   The Borrower shall prepay the Loans in accordance with the following:   (i)         If any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries Disposes of any Property (including any sale or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any of its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Capital Stock and any sales or issuances of Capital Stock to another Loan Party))      35    (other than any Disposition of any inventory permitted by Section 6.06(a)) which results in the realization by such Person of Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate during the term of this Agreement, the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds no later than two Business Days following receipt thereof by such Person (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clause (iv) below); provided, however, that with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds, at the election of the Borrower (as notified by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds), and so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary may apply such Net Cash Proceeds to reinvest in the purchase of capital assets useful in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary, in each case to be used in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary within 180 days following the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds (or, if within such 180-day period, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary enters into a binding commitment to so reinvest such Net Cash Proceeds, within 360 days following the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds); provided, further, that if within such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period after the date of receipt by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary of such Net Cash Proceeds, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary has not so used all or a portion of such Net Cash Proceeds otherwise required to be applied as a mandatory repayment pursuant to this Section 2.05(b)(i), the remaining portion of such Net Cash Proceeds shall be applied as a mandatory repayment in accordance with the requirements of this Section 2.05(b)(i) on the last day of such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period.   (ii)         Within two Business Days following any Extraordinary Receipt received by or paid to or for the account of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate during the term of this Agreement, and not otherwise included in this Section 2.05(b), the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clause (iv) below); provided, however, that with respect to such Extraordinary Receipts, at the election of the Borrower (as notified by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of receipt of such Extraordinary Receipts), and so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary may apply such Extraordinary Receipts to reinvest in the purchase of assets useful in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary, in each case to be used in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary within 180-days following the date of receipt of such Extraordinary      36       Receipts (or, if within such 180-day period, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary enters into a binding commitment to so reinvest such Extraordinary Receipts, within 360 days following the date of receipt of such Extraordinary Receipts); provided, further, that if within such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period after the date of receipt by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary of such Extraordinary Receipts, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary has not so used all or a portion of such Extraordinary Receipts otherwise required to be applied as a mandatory repayment pursuant to this sentence, the remaining portion of such Extraordinary Receipts shall be applied as a mandatory repayment in accordance with the requirements of this Section 2.05(b)(ii) on the last day of such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period.   (iii)         Upon the incurrence or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness expressly permitted to be incurred or issued pursuant to Section 6.01), the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom no later than two Business Days following receipt thereof by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clauses (iv) and (v) below).   (iv)         Each prepayment of Loans pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05(b) shall be shared among the Lenders ratably.   (c)         All prepayments of Loans under this Section 2.05 (and any repricing or amendment that effectively refinances any Loans hereunder), shall be made in an amount equal to the sum of (x) 100% of the principal amount of such Loans being prepaid (or repriced or effectively refinanced) plus (y) all accrued and unpaid interest on the amount of principal of such Loans being prepaid (or repriced or effectively refinanced) to but excluding the date of such prepayment (or repricing or refinancing) plus (z) the applicable Prepayment Premium. No amounts repaid hereunder may be reborrowed.   Section 2.06.  Interest Rates and Payment Dates.  (a) Except as provided in Section 2.06(b), (x) each LIBOR Rate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from and including the date of such LIBOR Rate Loan to and excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full, at a rate per annum which shall, during each Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period and (y) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from and including the date of such Base Rate Loan to and excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears in cash on each Interest Payment Date.      37    (b)         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default under Section 7.01(a) or Section 7.01(g), the Borrower shall pay interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Loan owing to each Lender, payable in arrears on the dates and in the manner referred to in clause (a) above, and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Loan pursuant to clause (a) above; and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount payable under the Loan Documents that is not paid when due, from the date such amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full, payable in arrears on the date such amount shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum that would be required to be paid at such time in respect of such amounts.   Section 2.07.  Payments and Computations.  (a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 2:00 p.m. on the day when due in U.S. Dollars to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Account, in same day funds, with payments being received by the Administrative Agent after such time being deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.06(d), from and after the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.   (b)         All computations of interest and of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.   (c)         Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest.      38       (d)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.   (e)         The Loan Parties’ obligation to pay all amounts due hereunder and under any other Loan Documents shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including:   (i)         any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, deduction, abatement, suspension, diminution, reduction, defense or other right which any Loan Party may have against any supplier, whether such supplier was paid from the proceeds of Loans or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever arising under or pursuant to any supply agreement or otherwise relating to the purchase of goods, other property or services from or by any such supplier;   (ii)         any defect in the condition, design, operation, or fitness for use of, or any damage to or loss or destruction of, any equipment or material provided by any such supplier;   (iii)         any actual or alleged default by any such supplier or any other Person under any supply agreement; or   (iv)         any other fact or circumstance relating to any supply agreement.   Section 2.08. Taxes. (a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings or other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender      39       or the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made all required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all such deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.   (b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or future stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a security interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).   (c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This indemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.   Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from the Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.      40       (d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.   (e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)      41    executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update      42       such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.   Section 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.   Section 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it (other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Loans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.   Section 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an inducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders its warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to adjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to be substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, or delivered in substitution or exchange for   43       any thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable (subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of the Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each case immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower will issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each Warrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the Closing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder a Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants to be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased by such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such Warrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such notice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants deliverable to such Warrantholder).   (c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal amount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue price allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue price and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent jurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.   Section 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such   44    Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.   Section 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a continuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that   45    any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof.   Section 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:   (i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;   (ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes); or   (iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;   and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case of clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.   (b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender   46    such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.   (c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.   (d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).   Section 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:   (a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);   (b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or   (c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;   excluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.     47    For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Loan was in fact so funded.   Section 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 9.13.   Section 2.17.   Survival.   Each party’s obligations under Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 shall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Loan Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.   Article 3 Representations and Warranties   Representations and Warranties of the Borrower. In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to enter into this Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make the Loans hereunder, the Borrower makes the following representations and warranties as to itself and its Subsidiaries:   Section 3.01.   Existence and Power.   The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to do business in each additional jurisdiction necessary or advisable for the conduct of its business, except for such failures to so qualify in such additional jurisdictions as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to own its Properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower has all requisite organizational power to borrow the Loans and issue the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Lenders and Warrantholders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof.   48       Section 3.02.    Authority.   The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower’s issuance of the Notes to the Lenders and the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Warrantholders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, are within such Person’s organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary organizational action on the part of such Person’s board of directors (or comparable body) and, if necessary such Person’s shareholders, members or partners, as the case may be.   Section 3.03.    Binding Effect.   Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto and each of the Notes and Warrants issued has been validly issued in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto enforceable against such Person in accordance with its respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other laws relative to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally in effect from time to time and by general principles of equity whether applied in equity or at law.   Section 3.04.    Capital Stock; Subsidiaries.   (a) As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, the authorized and issued shares of each class of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a). As of the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to any pre-emptive rights and owned of record and beneficially by the Persons listed on Schedule 3.04(a) free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.   (b)          As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a), neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of Capital Stock of, or have any direct or indirect equity interest in, any other Person.   (c)           Except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(c), as of the Closing Date and after giving effect to the Transactions, there are no securities outstanding that are convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, nor are there outstanding any rights to subscribe for or purchase, or any options or warrants for the purchase of, or any agreements (contingent or otherwise) providing for the issuance of, or any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to, any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower      49       or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares.   (d)          On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase, acquire or retire (i) any of its Capital Stock, (ii) any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any of its Capital Stock, or (iii) any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire any of its Capital Stock.   Section 3.05.   Business Operations and Other Information;   Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Effect. (a) The Borrower has heretofore delivered or caused to be delivered to each Lender copies of the Audited Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements”). The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as otherwise noted therein), consistently applied, and subject, in the case of each of the Financial Statements that are unaudited, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes, and present fairly in all material respects the Consolidated financial position and related Consolidated income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows (as applicable) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at each of the dates and for each of the periods respectively covered thereby.   (b)          As of December 31, 2013, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries had any Indebtedness or liability, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or any Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities, liabilities for material taxes, long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, except as reflected or reserved against on the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements or described in the notes thereto.   (c)          Attached as Schedule 3.05(c) is a copy of the latest (as of the Closing Date) projections of the consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flow of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (assuming consummation of the Transactions) for each of the fiscal years of the Borrower in the period from the Closing Date through 2015, including a detailed cash flow forecast for the 12-month period following the Closing Date. Such projections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on Schedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light of current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future financial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.   50       (d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of the historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then ended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial position and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of business on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date or at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to fairly reflect such assumptions.   (e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or which could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event which individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.   Section 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.    (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.06, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties or rights which, if adversely determined, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b)          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which seek to enjoin, or otherwise prevent the consummation of, the transactions contemplated herein or to recover any damages or obtain any relief as a result of any of the transactions contemplated herein in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority.   (c)          Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will be after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions, as the case may be, in default under or in violation of any Statute or Order, which default or violation, individually or in the aggregate together with all other such defaults and violations has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.07.   No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, issuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or   51    compliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the consummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to the Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the Organizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.   Section 3.08.   Consents, Etc.   No consent, approval or authorization of or declaration, registration or filing with any Governmental Authority or any nongovernmental Person is required in connection with the execution or delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents or the performance by any such Person of its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or as a condition to the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents, or the consummation of any component of the Transactions, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, registrations or filings as are listed on Schedule 3.08, all of which have been or will on or prior to the Closing Date be obtained or made and are or will then be in full force and effect, and except those which the failure to obtain or make could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.09.    Outstanding Indebtedness.   Schedule 6.01(a) sets forth a correct and complete list and brief description of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness evidenced by the Loans) existing on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, in each case showing the aggregate principal amount thereof (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn commitments with respect thereto), the name of the respective borrower and any other entity which directly or indirectly guarantees such debt and all Liens securing such Indebtedness.   Section 3.10.   Taxes.  The Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, has timely filed all U.S. federal and all material state, local and foreign tax returns, information returns and excise tax returns, forms and reports for Taxes (“Tax Returns”) with the appropriate Governmental Authority which were or are required to have been filed by or on behalf of any such Persons and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and accurately reflect in all material respects all liability for Taxes of the Borrower or Subsidiary taken as a whole for the periods covered thereby. All Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other material Taxes and assessments payable by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof have been timely paid to the appropriate Governmental      52       Authority, unless such Tax liability is being diligently contested in good faith and the Borrower and/or the appropriate Subsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, has adequately reserved against such Tax liability on its books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted with respect to any such Taxes as of the date hereof. No material Tax assessment against the Borrower, or any Subsidiary thereof has been proposed, formally or informally. The Tax liabilities of the Borrower and any Subsidiary thereof are adequately provided for on the relevant Person’s books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP.   Section 3.11.   Disclosure.   None of this Agreement nor any other document or certificate furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith (including the Financial Statements), taken in the aggregate, contained, as of its respective date and as of the Closing Date, and no document or certificate which shall be furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith, when taken as a whole with, all documents and certificates previously delivered, shall contain, as of its date of delivery, any untrue statement of a material fact, or as of any such date omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it being acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary from the projected results. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any facts (other than matters of a general economic or political nature) that individually or in the aggregate have had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.12.    Margin Regulations.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or intends to acquire any “margin stock” as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207). No part of the proceeds of the Loans or the Warrants will be used, and no part of the proceeds of any loans repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the Loans or the Warrants was used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or carrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in a violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220). Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries or any agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or the Loans to violate   53    Regulation U, Regulation X, Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter be in effect. As used in this Section 3.12, the term “purpose of buying or carrying” has the meaning assigned thereto in the aforesaid Regulation U.   Section 3.13.   Pension and Benefit Plans.   (a) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, each of the Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates is in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no Unfunded Pension Liability with respect to any Plans that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b)          Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign Pension Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all requirements of law applicable thereto and the respective requirements of the governing documents for such plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, none of the Borrower, any Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents has engaged in a transaction which would subject the Borrower or any Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to a tax or civil penalty. With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, reserves have been established in the financial statements furnished to Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities in accordance with applicable law and prudent business practice or, where required, in accordance with ordinary accounting practices in the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Pension Plan is maintained. The aggregate unfunded liabilities with respect to Foreign Pension Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect assuming proper funding and administration of such foreign Pension Plans on an ongoing basis.   Section 3.14.     Labor Matters.   As of the date hereof and the Closing Date, there are no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge the Borrower, threatened. The hours worked by and payments made to employees of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters. All payments due from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation      54    on the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.   Section 3.15.   Possession of Franchises, Licenses, Etc.   Each of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries possesses all material franchises, certificates, licenses, permits, registrations, security clearances, designations, approvals and other authorizations from Governmental Authorities that are necessary for the ownership, maintenance and operation of its Properties, and for the conduct of its business as now conducted, and neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any thereof, except for such violations as individually or in the aggregate do not, and could not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.16.   Intellectual Property.   The Borrower and its Subsidiaries own or otherwise possess sufficient rights to all trademarks, service marks, trade names, including all goodwill associated with any of the foregoing, patents, copyrights, domain names, including all registrations and applications for registration of any of the foregoing, inventions, technology, software, know-how (including trade secrets and other unpatented and/or unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures), database rights, rights of privacy and publicity, licenses and other intellectual property and similar rights (collectively, “IP Rights”) used in, held for use in or reasonably necessary for the operation of their respective businesses as currently conducted. Any and all IP Rights owned or purported to be owned by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries are owned solely and exclusively by the Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries, are owned free and clear of all Liens and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, are valid and enforceable. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor the use or sale of any of their products or the provision of any of their services, has materially infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the IP Rights of any Person. No claim, action, suit or proceeding regarding any IP Rights is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.   Section 3.17.   Use of Proceeds.   The proceeds from the Loans and the Warrants shall be used by the Borrower (i) to prepay in full the Manchester Seller Financing, (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions and (iii) for general corporate purposes consistent with the terms hereof.   Section 3.18.   OFAC; Anti-Corruption Laws.   Neither the Borrower, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, any director, officer, employee, agent, affiliate or representative thereof, is an individual or entity that is, or is owned or controlled by any individual or entity that is (i) currently the subject or target of any Sanctions or (ii) located, organized or resident in a Designated Jurisdiction. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have   55    conducted their businesses in compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws and have instituted and maintained policies and procedures designed to promote and achieve compliance with such laws.   Section 3.19.   Status under Certain Laws.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is an “investment company” or a “person directly or indirectly controlled by or acting on behalf of an investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.   Section 3.20.   Ranking of Loans.   The Indebtedness represented by the Loans and the other Loan Obligations under the applicable Loan Documents of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties is intended to constitute senior Indebtedness, and accordingly is, and shall be, at all times while the Loans and the other Loan Obligations remain outstanding senior in right of payment to, or pari passu with, all Indebtedness of the Loan Parties.   Section 3.21.   Solvency.   The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are Solvent on the Closing Date both before and after giving effect to the Transactions to be effected on the Closing Date and the application of the net proceeds of the Loans and the Warrants.   Section 3.22.     Restrictions on or Relating to Subsidiaries.   There does not exist any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of (x) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock or any other interest or participation in its profits owned by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, or to pay any Indebtedness owed to the Borrower or a Subsidiary thereof, (y) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to make loans or advances to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof or (z) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to transfer any of its properties or assets to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, except for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of (i) applicable law, (ii) the Loan Documents with respect to clause (z) only, Liens permitted to exist pursuant to Section 6.02 and (iii) with respect to clause (z) only, customary restrictions on assignment, subletting or transfer in any lease, license or contract. Except for customary provisions of corporate law regarding payment of Restricted Payments and exchange control requirements generally applicable to transfers of foreign currency, no Subsidiary of the Borrower is subject to any law which limits the amount or timing of the repatriation of profits or the payment of dividends to foreign shareholders.   Section 3.23.    Collateral Documents.   (a) On and after the Closing Date, the Security Agreement creates, as security for the Loan Obligations, a valid and enforceable perfected security interest in and Lien on all of the Collateral subject thereto, subject to no other Liens (other than Permitted Liens), in favor of the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders). No filings or recordings are required in order to perfect the security interests created under the   56    Security Agreement except for filings or recordings which shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent in completed and duly authorized form on or prior to the Closing Date.   (b)          On and after the Closing Date, the Foreign Pledge Agreement creates (or after the execution and delivery thereof will create), as security for the Loan Obligations, a valid and enforceable perfected security interest in and Lien on all of the Collateral subject thereto, superior to and prior to the rights of all third Persons, and subject to no other Liens (other than Permitted Liens), in favor of the Lenders.

No filings or recordings are required in order to perfect the security interests created under such Mortgage except for the recordation of such Mortgage in the appropriate recording office in the city or county in which the real property is located.   Section 3.24.    Environmental Matters.   (a) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:   (i)          there are no Environmental Liabilities of or relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, and there are no facts, conditions, situations or set of circumstances which could reasonably be expected to result in or be the basis for any such Environmental Liability;   (ii)         Hazardous Materials have not been Released on, at, under or from any property currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries;   (iii)        neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is undertaking, and has not completed, either individually or together with other potentially responsible parties, any investigation or assessment or remedial or response action relating to any actual or threatened Release of Hazardous Materials at, on, under, or from any site, location or operation; and all Hazardous Materials generated, used, treated, handled or stored at, or transported to or from, any property currently or formerly owned,   57    leased or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries have been properly disposed of pursuant to Environmental Laws;   (iv)        no Environmental Claim, fine or penalty is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened, nor are there any consent decrees or other decrees, consent orders, administrative orders or other orders, or other administrative or judicial requirements outstanding under any Environmental Law, in each case relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; and   (v)         the Borrower and its Subsidiaries are and have been in compliance with all Environmental Laws and have obtained and are and have been in compliance with all permits, licenses, authorizations, certificates and approvals of governmental authorities relating to or required by Environmental Laws.

The Borrower shall prepay the Loans in accordance with the following:   (i)         If any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries Disposes of any Property (including any sale or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any of its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Capital Stock and any sales or issuances of Capital Stock to another Loan Party))      35    (other than any Disposition of any inventory permitted by Section 6.06(a)) which results in the realization by such Person of Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate during the term of this Agreement, the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds no later than two Business Days following receipt thereof by such Person (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clause (iv) below); provided, however, that with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds, at the election of the Borrower (as notified by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds), and so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary may apply such Net Cash Proceeds to reinvest in the purchase of capital assets useful in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary, in each case to be used in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary within 180 days following the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds (or, if within such 180-day period, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary enters into a binding commitment to so reinvest such Net Cash Proceeds, within 360 days following the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds); provided, further, that if within such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period after the date of receipt by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary of such Net Cash Proceeds, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary has not so used all or a portion of such Net Cash Proceeds otherwise required to be applied as a mandatory repayment pursuant to this Section 2.05(b)(i), the remaining portion of such Net Cash Proceeds shall be applied as a mandatory repayment in accordance with the requirements of this Section 2.05(b)(i) on the last day of such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period.   (ii)         Within two Business Days following any Extraordinary Receipt received by or paid to or for the account of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate during the term of this Agreement, and not otherwise included in this Section 2.05(b), the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clause (iv) below); provided, however, that with respect to such Extraordinary Receipts, at the election of the Borrower (as notified by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of receipt of such Extraordinary Receipts), and so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary may apply such Extraordinary Receipts to reinvest in the purchase of assets useful in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary, in each case to be used in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary within 180-days following the date of receipt of such Extraordinary      36       Receipts (or, if within such 180-day period, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary enters into a binding commitment to so reinvest such Extraordinary Receipts, within 360 days following the date of receipt of such Extraordinary Receipts); provided, further, that if within such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period after the date of receipt by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary of such Extraordinary Receipts, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary has not so used all or a portion of such Extraordinary Receipts otherwise required to be applied as a mandatory repayment pursuant to this sentence, the remaining portion of such Extraordinary Receipts shall be applied as a mandatory repayment in accordance with the requirements of this Section 2.05(b)(ii) on the last day of such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period.   (iii)         Upon the incurrence or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness expressly permitted to be incurred or issued pursuant to Section 6.01), the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom no later than two Business Days following receipt thereof by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clauses (iv) and (v) below).   (iv)         Each prepayment of Loans pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05(b) shall be shared among the Lenders ratably.   (c)         All prepayments of Loans under this Section 2.05 (and any repricing or amendment that effectively refinances any Loans hereunder), shall be made in an amount equal to the sum of (x) 100% of the principal amount of such Loans being prepaid (or repriced or effectively refinanced) plus (y) all accrued and unpaid interest on the amount of principal of such Loans being prepaid (or repriced or effectively refinanced) to but excluding the date of such prepayment (or repricing or refinancing) plus (z) the applicable Prepayment Premium. No amounts repaid hereunder may be reborrowed.   Section 2.06.  Interest Rates and Payment Dates.  (a) Except as provided in Section 2.06(b), (x) each LIBOR Rate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from and including the date of such LIBOR Rate Loan to and excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full, at a rate per annum which shall, during each Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period and (y) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from and including the date of such Base Rate Loan to and excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears in cash on each Interest Payment Date.      37    (b)         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default under Section 7.01(a) or Section 7.01(g), the Borrower shall pay interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Loan owing to each Lender, payable in arrears on the dates and in the manner referred to in clause (a) above, and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Loan pursuant to clause (a) above; and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount payable under the Loan Documents that is not paid when due, from the date such amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full, payable in arrears on the date such amount shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum that would be required to be paid at such time in respect of such amounts.   Section 2.07.  Payments and Computations.  (a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 2:00 p.m. on the day when due in U.S. Dollars to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Account, in same day funds, with payments being received by the Administrative Agent after such time being deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.06(d), from and after the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.   (b)         All computations of interest and of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.   (c)         Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest.      38       (d)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.   (e)         The Loan Parties’ obligation to pay all amounts due hereunder and under any other Loan Documents shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including:   (i)         any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, deduction, abatement, suspension, diminution, reduction, defense or other right which any Loan Party may have against any supplier, whether such supplier was paid from the proceeds of Loans or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever arising under or pursuant to any supply agreement or otherwise relating to the purchase of goods, other property or services from or by any such supplier;   (ii)         any defect in the condition, design, operation, or fitness for use of, or any damage to or loss or destruction of, any equipment or material provided by any such supplier;   (iii)         any actual or alleged default by any such supplier or any other Person under any supply agreement; or   (iv)         any other fact or circumstance relating to any supply agreement.   Section 2.08. Taxes. (a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings or other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender      39       or the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made all required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all such deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.   (b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or future stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a security interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).   (c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This indemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.   Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from the Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.      40       (d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.   (e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)      41    executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update      42       such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.   Section 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.   Section 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it (other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Loans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.   Section 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an inducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders its warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to adjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to be substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, or delivered in substitution or exchange for   43       any thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable (subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of the Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each case immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower will issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each Warrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the Closing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder a Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants to be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased by such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such Warrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such notice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants deliverable to such Warrantholder).   (c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal amount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue price allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue price and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent jurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.   Section 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such   44    Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.   Section 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a continuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that   45    any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof.   Section 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:   (i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;   (ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes); or   (iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;   and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case of clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.   (b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender   46    such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.   (c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.   (d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).   Section 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:   (a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);   (b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or   (c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;   excluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.     47    For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Loan was in fact so funded.   Section 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 9.13.   Section 2.17.   Survival.   Each party’s obligations under Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 shall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Loan Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.   Article 3 Representations and Warranties   Representations and Warranties of the Borrower. In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to enter into this Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make the Loans hereunder, the Borrower makes the following representations and warranties as to itself and its Subsidiaries:   Section 3.01.   Existence and Power.   The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to do business in each additional jurisdiction necessary or advisable for the conduct of its business, except for such failures to so qualify in such additional jurisdictions as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to own its Properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower has all requisite organizational power to borrow the Loans and issue the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Lenders and Warrantholders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof.   48       Section 3.02.    Authority.   The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower’s issuance of the Notes to the Lenders and the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Warrantholders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, are within such Person’s organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary organizational action on the part of such Person’s board of directors (or comparable body) and, if necessary such Person’s shareholders, members or partners, as the case may be.   Section 3.03.    Binding Effect.   Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto and each of the Notes and Warrants issued has been validly issued in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto enforceable against such Person in accordance with its respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other laws relative to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally in effect from time to time and by general principles of equity whether applied in equity or at law.   Section 3.04.    Capital Stock; Subsidiaries.   (a) As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, the authorized and issued shares of each class of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a). As of the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to any pre-emptive rights and owned of record and beneficially by the Persons listed on Schedule 3.04(a) free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.   (b)          As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a), neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of Capital Stock of, or have any direct or indirect equity interest in, any other Person.   (c)           Except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(c), as of the Closing Date and after giving effect to the Transactions, there are no securities outstanding that are convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, nor are there outstanding any rights to subscribe for or purchase, or any options or warrants for the purchase of, or any agreements (contingent or otherwise) providing for the issuance of, or any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to, any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower      49       or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares.   (d)          On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase, acquire or retire (i) any of its Capital Stock, (ii) any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any of its Capital Stock, or (iii) any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire any of its Capital Stock.   Section 3.05.   Business Operations and Other Information;   Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Effect. (a) The Borrower has heretofore delivered or caused to be delivered to each Lender copies of the Audited Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements”). The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as otherwise noted therein), consistently applied, and subject, in the case of each of the Financial Statements that are unaudited, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes, and present fairly in all material respects the Consolidated financial position and related Consolidated income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows (as applicable) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at each of the dates and for each of the periods respectively covered thereby.   (b)          As of December 31, 2013, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries had any Indebtedness or liability, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or any Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities, liabilities for material taxes, long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, except as reflected or reserved against on the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements or described in the notes thereto.   (c)          Attached as Schedule 3.05(c) is a copy of the latest (as of the Closing Date) projections of the consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flow of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (assuming consummation of the Transactions) for each of the fiscal years of the Borrower in the period from the Closing Date through 2015, including a detailed cash flow forecast for the 12-month period following the Closing Date. Such projections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on Schedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light of current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future financial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.   50       (d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of the historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then ended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial position and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of business on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date or at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to fairly reflect such assumptions.   (e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or which could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event which individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.   Section 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.    (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.06, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties or rights which, if adversely determined, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b)          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which seek to enjoin, or otherwise prevent the consummation of, the transactions contemplated herein or to recover any damages or obtain any relief as a result of any of the transactions contemplated herein in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority.   (c)          Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will be after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions, as the case may be, in default under or in violation of any Statute or Order, which default or violation, individually or in the aggregate together with all other such defaults and violations has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.07.   No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, issuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or   51    compliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the consummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to the Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the Organizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.   Section 3.08.   Consents, Etc.   No consent, approval or authorization of or declaration, registration or filing with any Governmental Authority or any nongovernmental Person is required in connection with the execution or delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents or the performance by any such Person of its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or as a condition to the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents, or the consummation of any component of the Transactions, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, registrations or filings as are listed on Schedule 3.08, all of which have been or will on or prior to the Closing Date be obtained or made and are or will then be in full force and effect, and except those which the failure to obtain or make could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.09.    Outstanding Indebtedness.   Schedule 6.01(a) sets forth a correct and complete list and brief description of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness evidenced by the Loans) existing on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, in each case showing the aggregate principal amount thereof (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn commitments with respect thereto), the name of the respective borrower and any other entity which directly or indirectly guarantees such debt and all Liens securing such Indebtedness.   Section 3.10.   Taxes.  The Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, has timely filed all U.S. federal and all material state, local and foreign tax returns, information returns and excise tax returns, forms and reports for Taxes (“Tax Returns”) with the appropriate Governmental Authority which were or are required to have been filed by or on behalf of any such Persons and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and accurately reflect in all material respects all liability for Taxes of the Borrower or Subsidiary taken as a whole for the periods covered thereby. All Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other material Taxes and assessments payable by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof have been timely paid to the appropriate Governmental      52       Authority, unless such Tax liability is being diligently contested in good faith and the Borrower and/or the appropriate Subsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, has adequately reserved against such Tax liability on its books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted with respect to any such Taxes as of the date hereof. No material Tax assessment against the Borrower, or any Subsidiary thereof has been proposed, formally or informally. The Tax liabilities of the Borrower and any Subsidiary thereof are adequately provided for on the relevant Person’s books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP.   Section 3.11.   Disclosure.   None of this Agreement nor any other document or certificate furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith (including the Financial Statements), taken in the aggregate, contained, as of its respective date and as of the Closing Date, and no document or certificate which shall be furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith, when taken as a whole with, all documents and certificates previously delivered, shall contain, as of its date of delivery, any untrue statement of a material fact, or as of any such date omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it being acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary from the projected results. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any facts (other than matters of a general economic or political nature) that individually or in the aggregate have had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.12.    Margin Regulations.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or intends to acquire any “margin stock” as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207). No part of the proceeds of the Loans or the Warrants will be used, and no part of the proceeds of any loans repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the Loans or the Warrants was used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or carrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in a violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220). Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries or any agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or the Loans to violate   53    Regulation U, Regulation X, Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter be in effect. As used in this Section 3.12, the term “purpose of buying or carrying” has the meaning assigned thereto in the aforesaid Regulation U.   Section 3.13.   Pension and Benefit Plans.   (a) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, each of the Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates is in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no Unfunded Pension Liability with respect to any Plans that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b)          Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign Pension Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all requirements of law applicable thereto and the respective requirements of the governing documents for such plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, none of the Borrower, any Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents has engaged in a transaction which would subject the Borrower or any Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to a tax or civil penalty. With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, reserves have been established in the financial statements furnished to Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities in accordance with applicable law and prudent business practice or, where required, in accordance with ordinary accounting practices in the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Pension Plan is maintained. The aggregate unfunded liabilities with respect to Foreign Pension Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect assuming proper funding and administration of such foreign Pension Plans on an ongoing basis.   Section 3.14.     Labor Matters.   As of the date hereof and the Closing Date, there are no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge the Borrower, threatened. The hours worked by and payments made to employees of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters. All payments due from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation      54    on the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.   Section 3.15.   Possession of Franchises, Licenses, Etc.   Each of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries possesses all material franchises, certificates, licenses, permits, registrations, security clearances, designations, approvals and other authorizations from Governmental Authorities that are necessary for the ownership, maintenance and operation of its Properties, and for the conduct of its business as now conducted, and neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any thereof, except for such violations as individually or in the aggregate do not, and could not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.16.   Intellectual Property.   The Borrower and its Subsidiaries own or otherwise possess sufficient rights to all trademarks, service marks, trade names, including all goodwill associated with any of the foregoing, patents, copyrights, domain names, including all registrations and applications for registration of any of the foregoing, inventions, technology, software, know-how (including trade secrets and other unpatented and/or unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures), database rights, rights of privacy and publicity, licenses and other intellectual property and similar rights (collectively, “IP Rights”) used in, held for use in or reasonably necessary for the operation of their respective businesses as currently conducted. Any and all IP Rights owned or purported to be owned by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries are owned solely and exclusively by the Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries, are owned free and clear of all Liens and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, are valid and enforceable. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor the use or sale of any of their products or the provision of any of their services, has materially infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the IP Rights of any Person. No claim, action, suit or proceeding regarding any IP Rights is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.   Section 3.17.   Use of Proceeds.   The proceeds from the Loans and the Warrants shall be used by the Borrower (i) to prepay in full the Manchester Seller Financing, (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions and (iii) for general corporate purposes consistent with the terms hereof.   Section 3.18.   OFAC; Anti-Corruption Laws.   Neither the Borrower, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, any director, officer, employee, agent, affiliate or representative thereof, is an individual or entity that is, or is owned or controlled by any individual or entity that is (i) currently the subject or target of any Sanctions or (ii) located, organized or resident in a Designated Jurisdiction. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have   55    conducted their businesses in compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws and have instituted and maintained policies and procedures designed to promote and achieve compliance with such laws.   Section 3.19.   Status under Certain Laws.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is an “investment company” or a “person directly or indirectly controlled by or acting on behalf of an investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.   Section 3.20.   Ranking of Loans.   The Indebtedness represented by the Loans and the other Loan Obligations under the applicable Loan Documents of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties is intended to constitute senior Indebtedness, and accordingly is, and shall be, at all times while the Loans and the other Loan Obligations remain outstanding senior in right of payment to, or pari passu with, all Indebtedness of the Loan Parties.   Section 3.21.   Solvency.   The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are Solvent on the Closing Date both before and after giving effect to the Transactions to be effected on the Closing Date and the application of the net proceeds of the Loans and the Warrants.   Section 3.22.     Restrictions on or Relating to Subsidiaries.   There does not exist any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of (x) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock or any other interest or participation in its profits owned by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, or to pay any Indebtedness owed to the Borrower or a Subsidiary thereof, (y) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to make loans or advances to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof or (z) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to transfer any of its properties or assets to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, except for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of (i) applicable law, (ii) the Loan Documents with respect to clause (z) only, Liens permitted to exist pursuant to Section 6.02 and (iii) with respect to clause (z) only, customary restrictions on assignment, subletting or transfer in any lease, license or contract. Except for customary provisions of corporate law regarding payment of Restricted Payments and exchange control requirements generally applicable to transfers of foreign currency, no Subsidiary of the Borrower is subject to any law which limits the amount or timing of the repatriation of profits or the payment of dividends to foreign shareholders.   Section 3.23.    Collateral Documents.   (a) On and after the Closing Date, the Security Agreement creates, as security for the Loan Obligations, a valid and enforceable perfected security interest in and Lien on all of the Collateral subject thereto, subject to no other Liens (other than Permitted Liens), in favor of the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders).

(b)          On and after the Closing Date, the Foreign Pledge Agreement creates (or after the execution and delivery thereof will create), as security for the Loan Obligations, a valid and enforceable perfected security interest in and Lien on all of the Collateral subject thereto, superior to and prior to the rights of all third Persons, and subject to no other Liens (other than Permitted Liens), in favor of the Lenders.

No filings or recordings are required in order to perfect the security interests created under such Mortgage except for the recordation of such Mortgage in the appropriate recording office in the city or county in which the real property is located.

Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.   (c)         Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest.      38       (d)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

Section 2.08. Taxes. (a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings or other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender      39       or the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made all required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all such deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.   (b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or future stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a security interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).   (c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This indemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.   Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from the Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.      40       (d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.   (e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)      41    executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update      42       such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.   Section 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.   Section 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it (other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Loans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.   Section 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an inducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders its warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to adjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to be substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, or delivered in substitution or exchange for   43       any thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable (subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of the Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each case immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower will issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each Warrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the Closing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder a Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants to be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased by such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such Warrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such notice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants deliverable to such Warrantholder).   (c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal amount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue price allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue price and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent jurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.   Section 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such   44    Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.   Section 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a continuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that   45    any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof.   Section 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:   (i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;   (ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes); or   (iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;   and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case of clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.   (b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender   46    such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.   (c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.   (d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).   Section 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:   (a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);   (b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or   (c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;   excluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.     47    For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Loan was in fact so funded.   Section 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 9.13.   Section 2.17.   Survival.   Each party’s obligations under Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 shall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Loan Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.   Article 3 Representations and Warranties   Representations and Warranties of the Borrower. In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to enter into this Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make the Loans hereunder, the Borrower makes the following representations and warranties as to itself and its Subsidiaries:   Section 3.01.   Existence and Power.   The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to do business in each additional jurisdiction necessary or advisable for the conduct of its business, except for such failures to so qualify in such additional jurisdictions as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to own its Properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower has all requisite organizational power to borrow the Loans and issue the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Lenders and Warrantholders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof.   48       Section 3.02.    Authority.   The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower’s issuance of the Notes to the Lenders and the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Warrantholders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, are within such Person’s organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary organizational action on the part of such Person’s board of directors (or comparable body) and, if necessary such Person’s shareholders, members or partners, as the case may be.   Section 3.03.    Binding Effect.   Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto and each of the Notes and Warrants issued has been validly issued in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto enforceable against such Person in accordance with its respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other laws relative to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally in effect from time to time and by general principles of equity whether applied in equity or at law.   Section 3.04.    Capital Stock; Subsidiaries.   (a) As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, the authorized and issued shares of each class of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a). As of the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to any pre-emptive rights and owned of record and beneficially by the Persons listed on Schedule 3.04(a) free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.   (b)          As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a), neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of Capital Stock of, or have any direct or indirect equity interest in, any other Person.   (c)           Except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(c), as of the Closing Date and after giving effect to the Transactions, there are no securities outstanding that are convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, nor are there outstanding any rights to subscribe for or purchase, or any options or warrants for the purchase of, or any agreements (contingent or otherwise) providing for the issuance of, or any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to, any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower      49       or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares.   (d)          On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase, acquire or retire (i) any of its Capital Stock, (ii) any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any of its Capital Stock, or (iii) any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire any of its Capital Stock.   Section 3.05.   Business Operations and Other Information;   Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Effect. (a) The Borrower has heretofore delivered or caused to be delivered to each Lender copies of the Audited Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements”). The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as otherwise noted therein), consistently applied, and subject, in the case of each of the Financial Statements that are unaudited, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes, and present fairly in all material respects the Consolidated financial position and related Consolidated income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows (as applicable) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at each of the dates and for each of the periods respectively covered thereby.   (b)          As of December 31, 2013, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries had any Indebtedness or liability, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or any Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities, liabilities for material taxes, long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, except as reflected or reserved against on the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements or described in the notes thereto.   (c)          Attached as Schedule 3.05(c) is a copy of the latest (as of the Closing Date) projections of the consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flow of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (assuming consummation of the Transactions) for each of the fiscal years of the Borrower in the period from the Closing Date through 2015, including a detailed cash flow forecast for the 12-month period following the Closing Date. Such projections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on Schedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light of current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future financial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.   50       (d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of the historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then ended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial position and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of business on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date or at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to fairly reflect such assumptions.   (e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or which could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event which individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.   Section 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.    (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.06, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties or rights which, if adversely determined, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b)          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which seek to enjoin, or otherwise prevent the consummation of, the transactions contemplated herein or to recover any damages or obtain any relief as a result of any of the transactions contemplated herein in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority.   (c)          Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will be after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions, as the case may be, in default under or in violation of any Statute or Order, which default or violation, individually or in the aggregate together with all other such defaults and violations has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.07.   No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, issuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or   51    compliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the consummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to the Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the Organizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.   Section 3.08.   Consents, Etc.   No consent, approval or authorization of or declaration, registration or filing with any Governmental Authority or any nongovernmental Person is required in connection with the execution or delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents or the performance by any such Person of its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or as a condition to the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents, or the consummation of any component of the Transactions, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, registrations or filings as are listed on Schedule 3.08, all of which have been or will on or prior to the Closing Date be obtained or made and are or will then be in full force and effect, and except those which the failure to obtain or make could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.09.    Outstanding Indebtedness.   Schedule 6.01(a) sets forth a correct and complete list and brief description of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness evidenced by the Loans) existing on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, in each case showing the aggregate principal amount thereof (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn commitments with respect thereto), the name of the respective borrower and any other entity which directly or indirectly guarantees such debt and all Liens securing such Indebtedness.   Section 3.10.   Taxes.  The Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, has timely filed all U.S. federal and all material state, local and foreign tax returns, information returns and excise tax returns, forms and reports for Taxes (“Tax Returns”) with the appropriate Governmental Authority which were or are required to have been filed by or on behalf of any such Persons and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and accurately reflect in all material respects all liability for Taxes of the Borrower or Subsidiary taken as a whole for the periods covered thereby. All Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other material Taxes and assessments payable by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof have been timely paid to the appropriate Governmental      52       Authority, unless such Tax liability is being diligently contested in good faith and the Borrower and/or the appropriate Subsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, has adequately reserved against such Tax liability on its books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted with respect to any such Taxes as of the date hereof. No material Tax assessment against the Borrower, or any Subsidiary thereof has been proposed, formally or informally. The Tax liabilities of the Borrower and any Subsidiary thereof are adequately provided for on the relevant Person’s books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP.   Section 3.11.   Disclosure.   None of this Agreement nor any other document or certificate furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith (including the Financial Statements), taken in the aggregate, contained, as of its respective date and as of the Closing Date, and no document or certificate which shall be furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith, when taken as a whole with, all documents and certificates previously delivered, shall contain, as of its date of delivery, any untrue statement of a material fact, or as of any such date omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it being acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary from the projected results. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any facts (other than matters of a general economic or political nature) that individually or in the aggregate have had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or intends to acquire any “margin stock” as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207). No part of the proceeds of the Loans or the Warrants will be used, and no part of the proceeds of any loans repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the Loans or the Warrants was used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or carrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in a violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220). Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries or any agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or the Loans to violate   53    Regulation U, Regulation X, Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter be in effect. As used in this Section 3.12, the term “purpose of buying or carrying” has the meaning assigned thereto in the aforesaid Regulation U.   Section 3.13.   Pension and Benefit Plans.   (a) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, each of the Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates is in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no Unfunded Pension Liability with respect to any Plans that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b)          Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign Pension Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all requirements of law applicable thereto and the respective requirements of the governing documents for such plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, none of the Borrower, any Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents has engaged in a transaction which would subject the Borrower or any Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to a tax or civil penalty. With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, reserves have been established in the financial statements furnished to Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities in accordance with applicable law and prudent business practice or, where required, in accordance with ordinary accounting practices in the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Pension Plan is maintained. The aggregate unfunded liabilities with respect to Foreign Pension Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect assuming proper funding and administration of such foreign Pension Plans on an ongoing basis.

All payments due from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation      54    on the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.   Section 3.15.   Possession of Franchises, Licenses, Etc.

(e)         The Loan Parties’ obligation to pay all amounts due hereunder and under any other Loan Documents shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including:   (i)         any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, deduction, abatement, suspension, diminution, reduction, defense or other right which any Loan Party may have against any supplier, whether such supplier was paid from the proceeds of Loans or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever arising under or pursuant to any supply agreement or otherwise relating to the purchase of goods, other property or services from or by any such supplier;   (ii)         any defect in the condition, design, operation, or fitness for use of, or any damage to or loss or destruction of, any equipment or material provided by any such supplier;   (iii)         any actual or alleged default by any such supplier or any other Person under any supply agreement; or   (iv)         any other fact or circumstance relating to any supply agreement.   Section 2.08. Taxes. (a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings or other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender      39       or the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made all required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all such deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.   (b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or future stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a security interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).   (c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This indemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.   Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from the Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.      40       (d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.   (e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)      41    executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update      42       such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.   Section 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.   Section 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it (other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Loans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.   Section 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an inducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders its warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to adjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to be substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, or delivered in substitution or exchange for   43       any thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable (subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of the Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each case immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower will issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each Warrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the Closing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder a Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants to be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased by such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such Warrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such notice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants deliverable to such Warrantholder).   (c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal amount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue price allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue price and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent jurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.   Section 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such   44    Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.   Section 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a continuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that   45    any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof.   Section 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:   (i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;   (ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes); or   (iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;   and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case of clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.   (b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender   46    such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.   (c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.   (d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).   Section 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:   (a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);   (b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or   (c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;   excluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.     47    For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Loan was in fact so funded.   Section 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 9.13.   Section 2.17.   Survival.   Each party’s obligations under Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 shall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Loan Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.   Article 3 Representations and Warranties   Representations and Warranties of the Borrower. In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to enter into this Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make the Loans hereunder, the Borrower makes the following representations and warranties as to itself and its Subsidiaries:   Section 3.01.

The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower has all requisite organizational power to borrow the Loans and issue the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Lenders and Warrantholders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof.   48       Section 3.02.

The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower’s issuance of the Notes to the Lenders and the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Warrantholders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, are within such Person’s organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary organizational action on the part of such Person’s board of directors (or comparable body) and, if necessary such Person’s shareholders, members or partners, as the case may be.   Section 3.03.    Binding Effect.   Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto and each of the Notes and Warrants issued has been validly issued in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto enforceable against such Person in accordance with its respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other laws relative to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally in effect from time to time and by general principles of equity whether applied in equity or at law.   Section 3.04.    Capital Stock; Subsidiaries.   (a) As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, the authorized and issued shares of each class of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a). As of the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to any pre-emptive rights and owned of record and beneficially by the Persons listed on Schedule 3.04(a) free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.   (b)          As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a), neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of Capital Stock of, or have any direct or indirect equity interest in, any other Person.   (c)           Except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(c), as of the Closing Date and after giving effect to the Transactions, there are no securities outstanding that are convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, nor are there outstanding any rights to subscribe for or purchase, or any options or warrants for the purchase of, or any agreements (contingent or otherwise) providing for the issuance of, or any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to, any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower      49       or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares.   (d)          On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase, acquire or retire (i) any of its Capital Stock, (ii) any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any of its Capital Stock, or (iii) any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire any of its Capital Stock.   Section 3.05.   Business Operations and Other Information;   Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Effect. (a) The Borrower has heretofore delivered or caused to be delivered to each Lender copies of the Audited Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements”). The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as otherwise noted therein), consistently applied, and subject, in the case of each of the Financial Statements that are unaudited, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes, and present fairly in all material respects the Consolidated financial position and related Consolidated income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows (as applicable) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at each of the dates and for each of the periods respectively covered thereby.   (b)          As of December 31, 2013, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries had any Indebtedness or liability, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or any Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities, liabilities for material taxes, long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, except as reflected or reserved against on the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements or described in the notes thereto.   (c)          Attached as Schedule 3.05(c) is a copy of the latest (as of the Closing Date) projections of the consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flow of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (assuming consummation of the Transactions) for each of the fiscal years of the Borrower in the period from the Closing Date through 2015, including a detailed cash flow forecast for the 12-month period following the Closing Date. Such projections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on Schedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light of current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future financial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.   50       (d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of the historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then ended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial position and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of business on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date or at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to fairly reflect such assumptions.   (e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or which could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event which individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.   Section 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.    (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.06, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties or rights which, if adversely determined, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b)          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which seek to enjoin, or otherwise prevent the consummation of, the transactions contemplated herein or to recover any damages or obtain any relief as a result of any of the transactions contemplated herein in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority.   (c)          Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will be after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions, as the case may be, in default under or in violation of any Statute or Order, which default or violation, individually or in the aggregate together with all other such defaults and violations has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.07.   No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, issuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or   51    compliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the consummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to the Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the Organizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.   Section 3.08.   Consents, Etc.   No consent, approval or authorization of or declaration, registration or filing with any Governmental Authority or any nongovernmental Person is required in connection with the execution or delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents or the performance by any such Person of its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or as a condition to the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents, or the consummation of any component of the Transactions, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, registrations or filings as are listed on Schedule 3.08, all of which have been or will on or prior to the Closing Date be obtained or made and are or will then be in full force and effect, and except those which the failure to obtain or make could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.09.    Outstanding Indebtedness.   Schedule 6.01(a) sets forth a correct and complete list and brief description of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness evidenced by the Loans) existing on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, in each case showing the aggregate principal amount thereof (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn commitments with respect thereto), the name of the respective borrower and any other entity which directly or indirectly guarantees such debt and all Liens securing such Indebtedness.   Section 3.10.   Taxes.  The Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, has timely filed all U.S. federal and all material state, local and foreign tax returns, information returns and excise tax returns, forms and reports for Taxes (“Tax Returns”) with the appropriate Governmental Authority which were or are required to have been filed by or on behalf of any such Persons and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and accurately reflect in all material respects all liability for Taxes of the Borrower or Subsidiary taken as a whole for the periods covered thereby. All Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other material Taxes and assessments payable by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof have been timely paid to the appropriate Governmental      52       Authority, unless such Tax liability is being diligently contested in good faith and the Borrower and/or the appropriate Subsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, has adequately reserved against such Tax liability on its books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted with respect to any such Taxes as of the date hereof. No material Tax assessment against the Borrower, or any Subsidiary thereof has been proposed, formally or informally. The Tax liabilities of the Borrower and any Subsidiary thereof are adequately provided for on the relevant Person’s books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP.   Section 3.11.   Disclosure.   None of this Agreement nor any other document or certificate furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith (including the Financial Statements), taken in the aggregate, contained, as of its respective date and as of the Closing Date, and no document or certificate which shall be furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith, when taken as a whole with, all documents and certificates previously delivered, shall contain, as of its date of delivery, any untrue statement of a material fact, or as of any such date omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it being acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary from the projected results. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any facts (other than matters of a general economic or political nature) that individually or in the aggregate have had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.12.    Margin Regulations.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or intends to acquire any “margin stock” as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207). No part of the proceeds of the Loans or the Warrants will be used, and no part of the proceeds of any loans repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the Loans or the Warrants was used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or carrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in a violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220). Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries or any agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or the Loans to violate   53    Regulation U, Regulation X, Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter be in effect. As used in this Section 3.12, the term “purpose of buying or carrying” has the meaning assigned thereto in the aforesaid Regulation U.   Section 3.13.   Pension and Benefit Plans.   (a) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, each of the Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates is in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no Unfunded Pension Liability with respect to any Plans that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b)          Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign Pension Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all requirements of law applicable thereto and the respective requirements of the governing documents for such plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, none of the Borrower, any Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents has engaged in a transaction which would subject the Borrower or any Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to a tax or civil penalty. With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, reserves have been established in the financial statements furnished to Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities in accordance with applicable law and prudent business practice or, where required, in accordance with ordinary accounting practices in the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Pension Plan is maintained. The aggregate unfunded liabilities with respect to Foreign Pension Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect assuming proper funding and administration of such foreign Pension Plans on an ongoing basis.   Section 3.14.     Labor Matters.   As of the date hereof and the Closing Date, there are no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge the Borrower, threatened. The hours worked by and payments made to employees of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters. All payments due from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation      54    on the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.   Section 3.15.   Possession of Franchises, Licenses, Etc.   Each of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries possesses all material franchises, certificates, licenses, permits, registrations, security clearances, designations, approvals and other authorizations from Governmental Authorities that are necessary for the ownership, maintenance and operation of its Properties, and for the conduct of its business as now conducted, and neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any thereof, except for such violations as individually or in the aggregate do not, and could not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.16.   Intellectual Property.   The Borrower and its Subsidiaries own or otherwise possess sufficient rights to all trademarks, service marks, trade names, including all goodwill associated with any of the foregoing, patents, copyrights, domain names, including all registrations and applications for registration of any of the foregoing, inventions, technology, software, know-how (including trade secrets and other unpatented and/or unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures), database rights, rights of privacy and publicity, licenses and other intellectual property and similar rights (collectively, “IP Rights”) used in, held for use in or reasonably necessary for the operation of their respective businesses as currently conducted. Any and all IP Rights owned or purported to be owned by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries are owned solely and exclusively by the Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries, are owned free and clear of all Liens and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, are valid and enforceable. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor the use or sale of any of their products or the provision of any of their services, has materially infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the IP Rights of any Person. No claim, action, suit or proceeding regarding any IP Rights is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.   Section 3.17.   Use of Proceeds.   The proceeds from the Loans and the Warrants shall be used by the Borrower (i) to prepay in full the Manchester Seller Financing, (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions and (iii) for general corporate purposes consistent with the terms hereof.   Section 3.18.   OFAC; Anti-Corruption Laws.

The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have   55    conducted their businesses in compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws and have instituted and maintained policies and procedures designed to promote and achieve compliance with such laws.

Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is an “investment company” or a “person directly or indirectly controlled by or acting on behalf of an investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.   Section 3.20.   Ranking of Loans.   The Indebtedness represented by the Loans and the other Loan Obligations under the applicable Loan Documents of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties is intended to constitute senior Indebtedness, and accordingly is, and shall be, at all times while the Loans and the other Loan Obligations remain outstanding senior in right of payment to, or pari passu with, all Indebtedness of the Loan Parties.   Section 3.21.   Solvency.   The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are Solvent on the Closing Date both before and after giving effect to the Transactions to be effected on the Closing Date and the application of the net proceeds of the Loans and the Warrants.

There does not exist any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of (x) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock or any other interest or participation in its profits owned by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, or to pay any Indebtedness owed to the Borrower or a Subsidiary thereof, (y) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to make loans or advances to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof or (z) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to transfer any of its properties or assets to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, except for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of (i) applicable law, (ii) the Loan Documents with respect to clause (z) only, Liens permitted to exist pursuant to Section 6.02 and (iii) with respect to clause (z) only, customary restrictions on assignment, subletting or transfer in any lease, license or contract. Except for customary provisions of corporate law regarding payment of Restricted Payments and exchange control requirements generally applicable to transfers of foreign currency, no Subsidiary of the Borrower is subject to any law which limits the amount or timing of the repatriation of profits or the payment of dividends to foreign shareholders.   Section 3.23.    Collateral Documents.   (a) On and after the Closing Date, the Security Agreement creates, as security for the Loan Obligations, a valid and enforceable perfected security interest in and Lien on all of the Collateral subject thereto, subject to no other Liens (other than Permitted Liens), in favor of the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders).

Article 8  THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND COLLATERAL AGENT   Section 8.01. Appointment. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints (x) U.S. Bank as the administrative agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Administrative Agent is a party and (y) U.S. Bank as the collateral agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Collateral Agent is a party, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes each Agent to execute and deliver each other Loan Document on behalf of such Lender and to take such action on behalf of such Lender under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Agent is a party and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, is a party, together with such other actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against each applicable Agent. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Collateral Agent to execute and deliver any documents necessary or appropriate (as determined by the Lenders) to create rights of pledge governed by the laws of the Netherlands for the benefit of the Lenders and the Agents including, without limitation, a pledge on 65% of the outstanding voting Capital Stock of RTRX International C.V. pursuant to a Dutch-law governed Foreign Pledge Agreement among certain Subsidiaries of the Borrower and the Collateral Agent (the “Dutch CV Pledge”). Without prejudice to the provisions of this   88       Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree with the creation of a parallel debt obligation of the Pledgors as will be described in the Parallel Debt(s) (both as defined in the Dutch CV Pledge) including that any payment received by the Collateral Agent in respect of the Parallel Debt(s) will be deemed a satisfaction of a pro rata portion of the corresponding amounts of the Loan Obligations. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions.   Section 8.02.   Delegation of Duties.  Each Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub agents appointed by such Agent, and shall be entitled to the advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Each Agent and any such sub agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub agent. No Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that such Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub agents.   Section 8.03.    Exculpatory Provisions.   (a)          The Agents shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agents:   (i)          shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;   (ii)         shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the applicable Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Majority Lenders; provided that no Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law; and   (iii)        shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable      89       for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as an Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.   (b)          The Agents and their respective Related Parties shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Majority Lenders as the applicable Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 9.01 and 7.01, or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment.   (c)          No Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any recital, statement, warranty or representation (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, sufficiency, transferability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 4 or elsewhere herein or (vi) the preparation, filing or continuation of any UCC financing statements or other filings intended to perfect security interest in Collateral or the correctness of any such financing statements or filings.

No Agent shall have any liability to the Borrower, any other Loan Party, any Lender or any other Person for the Borrower’s, any other Loan Party’s or any Lender’s, as the case may be, performance of, or failure to perform, any of their respective obligations and duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. It is expressly acknowledged and agreed that no Agent is guaranteeing performance of or assuming liability for the obligations of the other parties to the Loan Documents or to the Collateral. No Agent shall be liable for (a) any indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages (including without limitation lost profits) whatsoever, even if it has been informed of the likelihood thereof and regardless of the form of      90       action or (b) any losses or delays arising from (i) any causes or acts beyond its control, (ii) any delay, error, omission or default of any mail, telegraph, cable or wireless agency or operator or (iii) the acts or edicts of any government or governmental agency or other group or entity exercising governmental powers.   Section 8.04.   Reliance by the Agents.  Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. Each Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note delivered hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with such Agent. Each Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Majority Lenders and it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Nothing contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall require any Agent to advance or expend its own funds. Each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Majority Lenders and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.   Section 8.05.   Notice of Default.   No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless it shall have received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default.” In the event that any Agent receives such a notice, such Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders and the other Agent. Each applicable Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Majority Lenders; provided that, unless and until such Agent shall have received such directions, such Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.   Section 8.06.     Non Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders.   Each Lender expressly acknowledges that no Agent nor any of its Related Parties has made any      91       representations or warranties to it and that no act by such Agent hereinafter taken, including, without limitation, any review of the affairs of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by such Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to each Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon such Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of an investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the applicable Agent hereunder or under any other applicable Loan Document, such Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any other Loan Party which may come into the possession of such Agent or any of its Related Parties.   Section 8.07.   Indemnification.   The Lenders will hold harmless and indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such and each of their respective Affiliates and each of their and their respective Affiliates’ respective officers, directors, employees, managers, managing members, agents, advisors, attorneys and representatives (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to the respective Loans made by such Lender outstanding on the date on which indemnification is sought, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the Loans and including, without limitation, attorneys fees and expenses) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, the Loans, the Facility, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such Agent’s liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from such Agent’s gross negligence or willful      92       misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment). The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.   Section 8.08.    Agents in Their Individual Capacities.   (a) Each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under the Loan Documents, to the extent it is a Lender, as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include such Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Each Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from, act as trustee under indentures of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower, any of its respective Subsidiaries, other Affiliates or any person that may do business with or own securities of the Loan Parties or any such Subsidiary or Affiliate, as if such person were not the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and such Agent and its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from the Loan Parties and its Affiliates for services in connection with the Loan Documents or otherwise, in all cases without any duty to account for the same to the Lenders.   (b)          Each Lender understands that the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, acting in their respective individual capacities, and their respective Affiliates (collectively, an “Agent’s Group”) are engaged in a wide range of financial services and businesses (including investment management, financing, securities trading, corporate and investment banking and research) (such services and businesses are collectively referred to in this Section 8.08(b) as “Activities”) and may engage in the Activities with or on behalf of one or more of the Loan Parties or their respective Affiliates. Furthermore, an Agent’s Group may, in undertaking the Activities, engage in trading in financial products or undertake other investment businesses for its own account or on behalf of others (including the Borrower and its Affiliates and including holding, for its own account or on behalf of others, equity, debt and similar positions in the Borrower or its Affiliates), including trading in or holding long, short or derivative positions in securities, loans or other financial products of the Borrower or its Affiliates. Each Lender understands and agrees that in engaging in the Activities, an Agent’s Group may receive or otherwise obtain information concerning the Borrower or its Affiliates (including information concerning the ability of the Borrower to perform its Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents) which information may not be available to any of the Lenders that are not members of such Agent’s Group. No Agent nor any member of any Agent’s Group shall have any duty to disclose to any Lender or use on behalf of the Lenders, and shall not be liable for the failure to so disclose or use, any information whatsoever about or derived from the Activities or otherwise (including any information concerning      93       the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower) or to account for any revenue or profits obtained in connection with the Activities, except that each Agent shall deliver or otherwise make available to each Lender such documents as are expressly required by any Loan Document to be transmitted by such Agent to the Lender.   (c)          Each Lender further understands that there may be situations where members of an Agent’s Group or their respective customers (including the Borrower and its Affiliates) either now have or may in the future have interests or take actions that may conflict with the interests of any one or more of the Lenders (including the interests of the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents). Each Lender agrees that no member of any Agent’s Group is or shall be required to restrict its activities as a result of the Person serving as Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, being a member of an Agent’s Group, and that each member of an Agent’s Group may undertake any Activities without further consultation with or notification to any Lender.   Section 8.09.    Successor Agent.   Each Agent may resign as Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, upon 30 days’ written notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. If any Agent shall resign as an Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, then the Majority Lenders shall appoint a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of such Agent hereunder; provided that so long as a Default or Event of Default has not occurred and is continuing, the prior consent of the Borrower shall be required prior to the appointment of such successor agent; and provided further that such consent from the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Effective upon such appointment and approval, the term “Administrative Agent” and/or “Collateral Agent,” as applicable, shall mean such successor agent, and, effective upon the earlier of such appointment and the expiration of such 30 days’ notice, the former Agent’s rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be terminated, in either case, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to  this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. After any retiring Agent’s resignation in such capacity, the provisions of this Article 8 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective upon the expiry of the 30 days’ notice, provided that the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, for purposes of any right of pledge governed by the laws of the Netherlands, including the Dutch CV Pledge, any resignation by the Collateral Agent shall not be effective with respect to its rights and obligations under the Parallel Debt(s), until such rights and obligations have been assumed by the successor Collateral Agent. Without      94       prejudice to the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the Collateral Agent will reasonably cooperate in the assumption of its rights and obligations under or in connection with the Parallel Debt(s) by any such successor and will reasonably cooperate in transferring to such successor Collateral Agent all rights under the Foreign Pledge Agreement to the extent governed by the laws of the Netherlands.

Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.   (c)         Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest.      38       (d)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

Section 2.08. Taxes. (a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings or other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender      39       or the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made all required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all such deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.   (b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or future stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a security interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).   (c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This indemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.   Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from the Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.      40       (d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.   (e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)      41    executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update      42       such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.   Section 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.   Section 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it (other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Loans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.   Section 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an inducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders its warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to adjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to be substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, or delivered in substitution or exchange for   43       any thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable (subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of the Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each case immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower will issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each Warrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the Closing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder a Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants to be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased by such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such Warrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such notice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants deliverable to such Warrantholder).   (c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal amount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue price allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue price and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent jurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.   Section 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such   44    Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.   Section 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a continuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that   45    any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof.   Section 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:   (i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;   (ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes); or   (iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;   and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case of clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.   (b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender   46    such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.   (c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.   (d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).   Section 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:   (a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);   (b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or   (c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;   excluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.     47    For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Loan was in fact so funded.   Section 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 9.13.   Section 2.17.   Survival.   Each party’s obligations under Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 shall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Loan Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.   Article 3 Representations and Warranties   Representations and Warranties of the Borrower. In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to enter into this Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make the Loans hereunder, the Borrower makes the following representations and warranties as to itself and its Subsidiaries:   Section 3.01.   Existence and Power.   The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to do business in each additional jurisdiction necessary or advisable for the conduct of its business, except for such failures to so qualify in such additional jurisdictions as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to own its Properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower has all requisite organizational power to borrow the Loans and issue the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Lenders and Warrantholders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof.   48       Section 3.02.    Authority.   The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower’s issuance of the Notes to the Lenders and the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Warrantholders in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, are within such Person’s organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary organizational action on the part of such Person’s board of directors (or comparable body) and, if necessary such Person’s shareholders, members or partners, as the case may be.   Section 3.03.    Binding Effect.   Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto and each of the Notes and Warrants issued has been validly issued in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto enforceable against such Person in accordance with its respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other laws relative to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally in effect from time to time and by general principles of equity whether applied in equity or at law.   Section 3.04.    Capital Stock; Subsidiaries.   (a) As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, the authorized and issued shares of each class of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a). As of the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to any pre-emptive rights and owned of record and beneficially by the Persons listed on Schedule 3.04(a) free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.   (b)          As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a), neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of Capital Stock of, or have any direct or indirect equity interest in, any other Person.   (c)           Except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(c), as of the Closing Date and after giving effect to the Transactions, there are no securities outstanding that are convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, nor are there outstanding any rights to subscribe for or purchase, or any options or warrants for the purchase of, or any agreements (contingent or otherwise) providing for the issuance of, or any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to, any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower      49       or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares.   (d)          On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase, acquire or retire (i) any of its Capital Stock, (ii) any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any of its Capital Stock, or (iii) any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire any of its Capital Stock.   Section 3.05.   Business Operations and Other Information;   Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Effect. (a) The Borrower has heretofore delivered or caused to be delivered to each Lender copies of the Audited Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements”). The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as otherwise noted therein), consistently applied, and subject, in the case of each of the Financial Statements that are unaudited, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes, and present fairly in all material respects the Consolidated financial position and related Consolidated income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows (as applicable) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at each of the dates and for each of the periods respectively covered thereby.   (b)          As of December 31, 2013, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries had any Indebtedness or liability, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or any Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities, liabilities for material taxes, long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, except as reflected or reserved against on the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements or described in the notes thereto.   (c)          Attached as Schedule 3.05(c) is a copy of the latest (as of the Closing Date) projections of the consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flow of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (assuming consummation of the Transactions) for each of the fiscal years of the Borrower in the period from the Closing Date through 2015, including a detailed cash flow forecast for the 12-month period following the Closing Date. Such projections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on Schedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light of current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future financial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.   50       (d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of the historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then ended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial position and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of business on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date or at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to fairly reflect such assumptions.   (e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or which could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event which individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.   Section 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.    (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.06, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties or rights which, if adversely determined, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b)          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which seek to enjoin, or otherwise prevent the consummation of, the transactions contemplated herein or to recover any damages or obtain any relief as a result of any of the transactions contemplated herein in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority.   (c)          Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will be after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions, as the case may be, in default under or in violation of any Statute or Order, which default or violation, individually or in the aggregate together with all other such defaults and violations has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.07.   No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, issuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or   51    compliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the consummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to the Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the Organizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.   Section 3.08.   Consents, Etc.   No consent, approval or authorization of or declaration, registration or filing with any Governmental Authority or any nongovernmental Person is required in connection with the execution or delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents or the performance by any such Person of its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or as a condition to the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents, or the consummation of any component of the Transactions, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, registrations or filings as are listed on Schedule 3.08, all of which have been or will on or prior to the Closing Date be obtained or made and are or will then be in full force and effect, and except those which the failure to obtain or make could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.09.    Outstanding Indebtedness.   Schedule 6.01(a) sets forth a correct and complete list and brief description of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness evidenced by the Loans) existing on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, in each case showing the aggregate principal amount thereof (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn commitments with respect thereto), the name of the respective borrower and any other entity which directly or indirectly guarantees such debt and all Liens securing such Indebtedness.   Section 3.10.   Taxes.  The Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, has timely filed all U.S. federal and all material state, local and foreign tax returns, information returns and excise tax returns, forms and reports for Taxes (“Tax Returns”) with the appropriate Governmental Authority which were or are required to have been filed by or on behalf of any such Persons and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and accurately reflect in all material respects all liability for Taxes of the Borrower or Subsidiary taken as a whole for the periods covered thereby. All Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other material Taxes and assessments payable by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof have been timely paid to the appropriate Governmental      52       Authority, unless such Tax liability is being diligently contested in good faith and the Borrower and/or the appropriate Subsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, has adequately reserved against such Tax liability on its books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted with respect to any such Taxes as of the date hereof. No material Tax assessment against the Borrower, or any Subsidiary thereof has been proposed, formally or informally. The Tax liabilities of the Borrower and any Subsidiary thereof are adequately provided for on the relevant Person’s books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP.   Section 3.11.   Disclosure.   None of this Agreement nor any other document or certificate furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith (including the Financial Statements), taken in the aggregate, contained, as of its respective date and as of the Closing Date, and no document or certificate which shall be furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith, when taken as a whole with, all documents and certificates previously delivered, shall contain, as of its date of delivery, any untrue statement of a material fact, or as of any such date omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it being acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary from the projected results. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any facts (other than matters of a general economic or political nature) that individually or in the aggregate have had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or intends to acquire any “margin stock” as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207). No part of the proceeds of the Loans or the Warrants will be used, and no part of the proceeds of any loans repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the Loans or the Warrants was used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or carrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in a violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220). Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries or any agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or the Loans to violate   53    Regulation U, Regulation X, Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter be in effect. As used in this Section 3.12, the term “purpose of buying or carrying” has the meaning assigned thereto in the aforesaid Regulation U.   Section 3.13.   Pension and Benefit Plans.   (a) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, each of the Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates is in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no Unfunded Pension Liability with respect to any Plans that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b)          Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign Pension Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all requirements of law applicable thereto and the respective requirements of the governing documents for such plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, none of the Borrower, any Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents has engaged in a transaction which would subject the Borrower or any Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to a tax or civil penalty. With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, reserves have been established in the financial statements furnished to Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities in accordance with applicable law and prudent business practice or, where required, in accordance with ordinary accounting practices in the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Pension Plan is maintained. The aggregate unfunded liabilities with respect to Foreign Pension Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect assuming proper funding and administration of such foreign Pension Plans on an ongoing basis.

All payments due from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation      54    on the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.   Section 3.15.   Possession of Franchises, Licenses, Etc.

Article 8  THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND COLLATERAL AGENT   Section 8.01. Appointment. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints (x) U.S. Bank as the administrative agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Administrative Agent is a party and (y) U.S. Bank as the collateral agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Collateral Agent is a party, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes each Agent to execute and deliver each other Loan Document on behalf of such Lender and to take such action on behalf of such Lender under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Agent is a party and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, is a party, together with such other actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against each applicable Agent. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Collateral Agent to execute and deliver any documents necessary or appropriate (as determined by the Lenders) to create rights of pledge governed by the laws of the Netherlands for the benefit of the Lenders and the Agents including, without limitation, a pledge on 65% of the outstanding voting Capital Stock of RTRX International C.V. pursuant to a Dutch-law governed Foreign Pledge Agreement among certain Subsidiaries of the Borrower and the Collateral Agent (the “Dutch CV Pledge”). Without prejudice to the provisions of this   88       Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree with the creation of a parallel debt obligation of the Pledgors as will be described in the Parallel Debt(s) (both as defined in the Dutch CV Pledge) including that any payment received by the Collateral Agent in respect of the Parallel Debt(s) will be deemed a satisfaction of a pro rata portion of the corresponding amounts of the Loan Obligations. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions.   Section 8.02.   Delegation of Duties.  Each Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub agents appointed by such Agent, and shall be entitled to the advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Each Agent and any such sub agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub agent. No Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that such Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub agents.   Section 8.03.    Exculpatory Provisions.

Each Lender agrees that no member of any Agent’s Group is or shall be required to restrict its activities as a result of the Person serving as Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, being a member of an Agent’s Group, and that each member of an Agent’s Group may undertake any Activities without further consultation with or notification to any Lender.   Section 8.09.    Successor Agent.   Each Agent may resign as Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, upon 30 days’ written notice to the Lenders and the Borrower.

Effective upon such appointment and approval, the term “Administrative Agent” and/or “Collateral Agent,” as applicable, shall mean such successor agent, and, effective upon the earlier of such appointment and the expiration of such 30 days’ notice, the former Agent’s rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be terminated, in either case, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to  this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. After any retiring Agent’s resignation in such capacity, the provisions of this Article 8 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective upon the expiry of the 30 days’ notice, provided that the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, for purposes of any right of pledge governed by the laws of the Netherlands, including the Dutch CV Pledge, any resignation by the Collateral Agent shall not be effective with respect to its rights and obligations under the Parallel Debt(s), until such rights and obligations have been assumed by the successor Collateral Agent. Without      94       prejudice to the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the Collateral Agent will reasonably cooperate in the assumption of its rights and obligations under or in connection with the Parallel Debt(s) by any such successor and will reasonably cooperate in transferring to such successor Collateral Agent all rights under the Foreign Pledge Agreement to the extent governed by the laws of the Netherlands.

(b)         All computations of interest and of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.   (c)         Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest.      38       (d)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.   (e)         The Loan Parties’ obligation to pay all amounts due hereunder and under any other Loan Documents shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including:   (i)         any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, deduction, abatement, suspension, diminution, reduction, defense or other right which any Loan Party may have against any supplier, whether such supplier was paid from the proceeds of Loans or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever arising under or pursuant to any supply agreement or otherwise relating to the purchase of goods, other property or services from or by any such supplier;   (ii)         any defect in the condition, design, operation, or fitness for use of, or any damage to or loss or destruction of, any equipment or material provided by any such supplier;   (iii)         any actual or alleged default by any such supplier or any other Person under any supply agreement; or   (iv)         any other fact or circumstance relating to any supply agreement.   Section 2.08. Taxes. (a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings or other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender      39       or the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made all required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all such deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.   (b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or future stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a security interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).   (c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This indemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.   Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from the Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.      40       (d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.   (e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)      41    executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update      42       such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.   Section 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.   Section 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it (other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Loans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.   Section 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an inducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders its warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to adjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to be substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, or delivered in substitution or exchange for   43       any thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable (subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of the Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each case immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower will issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each Warrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the Closing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder a Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants to be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased by such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such Warrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such notice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants deliverable to such Warrantholder).   (c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal amount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue price allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue price and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent jurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.   Section 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such   44    Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.   Section 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a continuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that   45    any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof.   Section 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:   (i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;   (ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes); or   (iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;   and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case of clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.   (b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender   46    such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.   (c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.   (d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).   Section 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:   (a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);   (b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or   (c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;   excluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.     47    For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Loan was in fact so funded.   Section 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 9.13.   Section 2.17.   Survival.   Each party’s obligations under Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 shall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Loan Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.

Such projections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on Schedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light of current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future financial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.   50       (d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of the historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then ended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial position and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of business on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date or at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to fairly reflect such assumptions.   (e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or which could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event which individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.   Section 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.    (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.06, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties or rights which, if adversely determined, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b)          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which seek to enjoin, or otherwise prevent the consummation of, the transactions contemplated herein or to recover any damages or obtain any relief as a result of any of the transactions contemplated herein in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority.   (c)          Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will be after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions, as the case may be, in default under or in violation of any Statute or Order, which default or violation, individually or in the aggregate together with all other such defaults and violations has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.07.   No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, issuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or   51    compliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the consummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to the Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the Organizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.   Section 3.08.   Consents, Etc.   No consent, approval or authorization of or declaration, registration or filing with any Governmental Authority or any nongovernmental Person is required in connection with the execution or delivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents or the performance by any such Person of its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or as a condition to the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents, or the consummation of any component of the Transactions, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, registrations or filings as are listed on Schedule 3.08, all of which have been or will on or prior to the Closing Date be obtained or made and are or will then be in full force and effect, and except those which the failure to obtain or make could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.09.    Outstanding Indebtedness.   Schedule 6.01(a) sets forth a correct and complete list and brief description of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness evidenced by the Loans) existing on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, in each case showing the aggregate principal amount thereof (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn commitments with respect thereto), the name of the respective borrower and any other entity which directly or indirectly guarantees such debt and all Liens securing such Indebtedness.   Section 3.10.   Taxes.  The Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, has timely filed all U.S. federal and all material state, local and foreign tax returns, information returns and excise tax returns, forms and reports for Taxes (“Tax Returns”) with the appropriate Governmental Authority which were or are required to have been filed by or on behalf of any such Persons and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and accurately reflect in all material respects all liability for Taxes of the Borrower or Subsidiary taken as a whole for the periods covered thereby. All Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other material Taxes and assessments payable by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof have been timely paid to the appropriate Governmental      52       Authority, unless such Tax liability is being diligently contested in good faith and the Borrower and/or the appropriate Subsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, has adequately reserved against such Tax liability on its books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted with respect to any such Taxes as of the date hereof. No material Tax assessment against the Borrower, or any Subsidiary thereof has been proposed, formally or informally. The Tax liabilities of the Borrower and any Subsidiary thereof are adequately provided for on the relevant Person’s books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP.   Section 3.11.   Disclosure.   None of this Agreement nor any other document or certificate furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith (including the Financial Statements), taken in the aggregate, contained, as of its respective date and as of the Closing Date, and no document or certificate which shall be furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith, when taken as a whole with, all documents and certificates previously delivered, shall contain, as of its date of delivery, any untrue statement of a material fact, or as of any such date omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it being acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary from the projected results. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any facts (other than matters of a general economic or political nature) that individually or in the aggregate have had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.12.    Margin Regulations.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or intends to acquire any “margin stock” as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207). No part of the proceeds of the Loans or the Warrants will be used, and no part of the proceeds of any loans repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the Loans or the Warrants was used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or carrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in a violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220). Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries or any agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or the Loans to violate   53    Regulation U, Regulation X, Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter be in effect. As used in this Section 3.12, the term “purpose of buying or carrying” has the meaning assigned thereto in the aforesaid Regulation U.   Section 3.13.   Pension and Benefit Plans.   (a) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, each of the Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates is in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no Unfunded Pension Liability with respect to any Plans that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b)          Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign Pension Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all requirements of law applicable thereto and the respective requirements of the governing documents for such plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, none of the Borrower, any Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents has engaged in a transaction which would subject the Borrower or any Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to a tax or civil penalty. With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, reserves have been established in the financial statements furnished to Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities in accordance with applicable law and prudent business practice or, where required, in accordance with ordinary accounting practices in the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Pension Plan is maintained. The aggregate unfunded liabilities with respect to Foreign Pension Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect assuming proper funding and administration of such foreign Pension Plans on an ongoing basis.   Section 3.14.     Labor Matters.   As of the date hereof and the Closing Date, there are no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge the Borrower, threatened. The hours worked by and payments made to employees of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters. All payments due from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation      54    on the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.   Section 3.15.   Possession of Franchises, Licenses, Etc.   Each of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries possesses all material franchises, certificates, licenses, permits, registrations, security clearances, designations, approvals and other authorizations from Governmental Authorities that are necessary for the ownership, maintenance and operation of its Properties, and for the conduct of its business as now conducted, and neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any thereof, except for such violations as individually or in the aggregate do not, and could not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.16.   Intellectual Property.   The Borrower and its Subsidiaries own or otherwise possess sufficient rights to all trademarks, service marks, trade names, including all goodwill associated with any of the foregoing, patents, copyrights, domain names, including all registrations and applications for registration of any of the foregoing, inventions, technology, software, know-how (including trade secrets and other unpatented and/or unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures), database rights, rights of privacy and publicity, licenses and other intellectual property and similar rights (collectively, “IP Rights”) used in, held for use in or reasonably necessary for the operation of their respective businesses as currently conducted. Any and all IP Rights owned or purported to be owned by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries are owned solely and exclusively by the Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries, are owned free and clear of all Liens and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, are valid and enforceable. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor the use or sale of any of their products or the provision of any of their services, has materially infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the IP Rights of any Person. No claim, action, suit or proceeding regarding any IP Rights is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.   Section 3.17.   Use of Proceeds.   The proceeds from the Loans and the Warrants shall be used by the Borrower (i) to prepay in full the Manchester Seller Financing, (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions and (iii) for general corporate purposes consistent with the terms hereof.   Section 3.18.   OFAC; Anti-Corruption Laws.

The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have   55    conducted their businesses in compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws and have instituted and maintained policies and procedures designed to promote and achieve compliance with such laws.

Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is an “investment company” or a “person directly or indirectly controlled by or acting on behalf of an investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.   Section 3.20.   Ranking of Loans.   The Indebtedness represented by the Loans and the other Loan Obligations under the applicable Loan Documents of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties is intended to constitute senior Indebtedness, and accordingly is, and shall be, at all times while the Loans and the other Loan Obligations remain outstanding senior in right of payment to, or pari passu with, all Indebtedness of the Loan Parties.   Section 3.21.   Solvency.   The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are Solvent on the Closing Date both before and after giving effect to the Transactions to be effected on the Closing Date and the application of the net proceeds of the Loans and the Warrants.

There does not exist any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of (x) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock or any other interest or participation in its profits owned by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, or to pay any Indebtedness owed to the Borrower or a Subsidiary thereof, (y) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to make loans or advances to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof or (z) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to transfer any of its properties or assets to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, except for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of (i) applicable law, (ii) the Loan Documents with respect to clause (z) only, Liens permitted to exist pursuant to Section 6.02 and (iii) with respect to clause (z) only, customary restrictions on assignment, subletting or transfer in any lease, license or contract. Except for customary provisions of corporate law regarding payment of Restricted Payments and exchange control requirements generally applicable to transfers of foreign currency, no Subsidiary of the Borrower is subject to any law which limits the amount or timing of the repatriation of profits or the payment of dividends to foreign shareholders.   Section 3.23.    Collateral Documents.   (a) On and after the Closing Date, the Security Agreement creates, as security for the Loan Obligations, a valid and enforceable perfected security interest in and Lien on all of the Collateral subject thereto, subject to no other Liens (other than Permitted Liens), in favor of the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders).

Except as expressly provided above in this Article 7, presentment, demand, protest and all other notices of any kind are hereby expressly waived.   Article 8  THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND COLLATERAL AGENT   Section 8.01. Appointment. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints (x) U.S. Bank as the administrative agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Administrative Agent is a party and (y) U.S. Bank as the collateral agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Collateral Agent is a party, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes each Agent to execute and deliver each other Loan Document on behalf of such Lender and to take such action on behalf of such Lender under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Agent is a party and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, is a party, together with such other actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against each applicable Agent. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Collateral Agent to execute and deliver any documents necessary or appropriate (as determined by the Lenders) to create rights of pledge governed by the laws of the Netherlands for the benefit of the Lenders and the Agents including, without limitation, a pledge on 65% of the outstanding voting Capital Stock of RTRX International C.V. pursuant to a Dutch-law governed Foreign Pledge Agreement among certain Subsidiaries of the Borrower and the Collateral Agent (the “Dutch CV Pledge”). Without prejudice to the provisions of this   88       Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree with the creation of a parallel debt obligation of the Pledgors as will be described in the Parallel Debt(s) (both as defined in the Dutch CV Pledge) including that any payment received by the Collateral Agent in respect of the Parallel Debt(s) will be deemed a satisfaction of a pro rata portion of the corresponding amounts of the Loan Obligations. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions.   Section 8.02.   Delegation of Duties.  Each Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub agents appointed by such Agent, and shall be entitled to the advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Each Agent and any such sub agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub agent. No Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that such Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub agents.   Section 8.03.    Exculpatory Provisions.   (a)          The Agents shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agents:   (i)          shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;   (ii)         shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the applicable Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Majority Lenders; provided that no Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law; and   (iii)        shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable      89       for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as an Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.   (b)          The Agents and their respective Related Parties shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Majority Lenders as the applicable Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 9.01 and 7.01, or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment.   (c)          No Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any recital, statement, warranty or representation (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, sufficiency, transferability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 4 or elsewhere herein or (vi) the preparation, filing or continuation of any UCC financing statements or other filings intended to perfect security interest in Collateral or the correctness of any such financing statements or filings. No Agent shall be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Borrower or any other Loan Party. No Agent shall be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, ownership, transferability, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Collateral Agent’s Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection therewith, nor shall any Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral. No Agent shall have any liability to the Borrower, any other Loan Party, any Lender or any other Person for the Borrower’s, any other Loan Party’s or any Lender’s, as the case may be, performance of, or failure to perform, any of their respective obligations and duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. It is expressly acknowledged and agreed that no Agent is guaranteeing performance of or assuming liability for the obligations of the other parties to the Loan Documents or to the Collateral. No Agent shall be liable for (a) any indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages (including without limitation lost profits) whatsoever, even if it has been informed of the likelihood thereof and regardless of the form of      90       action or (b) any losses or delays arising from (i) any causes or acts beyond its control, (ii) any delay, error, omission or default of any mail, telegraph, cable or wireless agency or operator or (iii) the acts or edicts of any government or governmental agency or other group or entity exercising governmental powers.   Section 8.04.   Reliance by the Agents.  Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. Each Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note delivered hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with such Agent. Each Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Majority Lenders and it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Nothing contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall require any Agent to advance or expend its own funds. Each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Majority Lenders and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.   Section 8.05.   Notice of Default.   No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless it shall have received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default.” In the event that any Agent receives such a notice, such Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders and the other Agent. Each applicable Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Majority Lenders; provided that, unless and until such Agent shall have received such directions, such Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.   Section 8.06.     Non Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders.   Each Lender expressly acknowledges that no Agent nor any of its Related Parties has made any      91       representations or warranties to it and that no act by such Agent hereinafter taken, including, without limitation, any review of the affairs of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by such Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to each Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon such Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of an investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the applicable Agent hereunder or under any other applicable Loan Document, such Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any other Loan Party which may come into the possession of such Agent or any of its Related Parties.   Section 8.07.   Indemnification.   The Lenders will hold harmless and indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such and each of their respective Affiliates and each of their and their respective Affiliates’ respective officers, directors, employees, managers, managing members, agents, advisors, attorneys and representatives (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to the respective Loans made by such Lender outstanding on the date on which indemnification is sought, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the Loans and including, without limitation, attorneys fees and expenses) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, the Loans, the Facility, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such Agent’s liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from such Agent’s gross negligence or willful      92       misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment). The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.   Section 8.08.    Agents in Their Individual Capacities.   (a) Each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under the Loan Documents, to the extent it is a Lender, as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include such Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Each Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from, act as trustee under indentures of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower, any of its respective Subsidiaries, other Affiliates or any person that may do business with or own securities of the Loan Parties or any such Subsidiary or Affiliate, as if such person were not the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and such Agent and its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from the Loan Parties and its Affiliates for services in connection with the Loan Documents or otherwise, in all cases without any duty to account for the same to the Lenders.   (b)          Each Lender understands that the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, acting in their respective individual capacities, and their respective Affiliates (collectively, an “Agent’s Group”) are engaged in a wide range of financial services and businesses (including investment management, financing, securities trading, corporate and investment banking and research) (such services and businesses are collectively referred to in this Section 8.08(b) as “Activities”) and may engage in the Activities with or on behalf of one or more of the Loan Parties or their respective Affiliates. Furthermore, an Agent’s Group may, in undertaking the Activities, engage in trading in financial products or undertake other investment businesses for its own account or on behalf of others (including the Borrower and its Affiliates and including holding, for its own account or on behalf of others, equity, debt and similar positions in the Borrower or its Affiliates), including trading in or holding long, short or derivative positions in securities, loans or other financial products of the Borrower or its Affiliates. Each Lender understands and agrees that in engaging in the Activities, an Agent’s Group may receive or otherwise obtain information concerning the Borrower or its Affiliates (including information concerning the ability of the Borrower to perform its Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents) which information may not be available to any of the Lenders that are not members of such Agent’s Group. No Agent nor any member of any Agent’s Group shall have any duty to disclose to any Lender or use on behalf of the Lenders, and shall not be liable for the failure to so disclose or use, any information whatsoever about or derived from the Activities or otherwise (including any information concerning      93       the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower) or to account for any revenue or profits obtained in connection with the Activities, except that each Agent shall deliver or otherwise make available to each Lender such documents as are expressly required by any Loan Document to be transmitted by such Agent to the Lender.   (c)          Each Lender further understands that there may be situations where members of an Agent’s Group or their respective customers (including the Borrower and its Affiliates) either now have or may in the future have interests or take actions that may conflict with the interests of any one or more of the Lenders (including the interests of the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents). Each Lender agrees that no member of any Agent’s Group is or shall be required to restrict its activities as a result of the Person serving as Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, being a member of an Agent’s Group, and that each member of an Agent’s Group may undertake any Activities without further consultation with or notification to any Lender.   Section 8.09.    Successor Agent.   Each Agent may resign as Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, upon 30 days’ written notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. If any Agent shall resign as an Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, then the Majority Lenders shall appoint a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of such Agent hereunder; provided that so long as a Default or Event of Default has not occurred and is continuing, the prior consent of the Borrower shall be required prior to the appointment of such successor agent; and provided further that such consent from the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Effective upon such appointment and approval, the term “Administrative Agent” and/or “Collateral Agent,” as applicable, shall mean such successor agent, and, effective upon the earlier of such appointment and the expiration of such 30 days’ notice, the former Agent’s rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be terminated, in either case, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to  this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. After any retiring Agent’s resignation in such capacity, the provisions of this Article 8 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective upon the expiry of the 30 days’ notice, provided that the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, for purposes of any right of pledge governed by the laws of the Netherlands, including the Dutch CV Pledge, any resignation by the Collateral Agent shall not be effective with respect to its rights and obligations under the Parallel Debt(s), until such rights and obligations have been assumed by the successor Collateral Agent. Without      94       prejudice to the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the Collateral Agent will reasonably cooperate in the assumption of its rights and obligations under or in connection with the Parallel Debt(s) by any such successor and will reasonably cooperate in transferring to such successor Collateral Agent all rights under the Foreign Pledge Agreement to the extent governed by the laws of the Netherlands.   Section 8.10.   Lenders as Agent.   Upon written notice to the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, and the Borrower by the Majority Lenders, any provision of the Loan Documents requiring the consent or agreement or other approval or action of the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, may instead require the consent, agreement or other approval or action of the Majority Lenders; provided, however, for the avoidance of doubt, any such consent, agreement, approval or action which affects the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in its capacity as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent shall require the consent of the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable.   Article 9  MISCELLANEOUS   Section 9.01.   Amendments and Waivers.   Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document (other than the Warrants), nor any terms hereof or thereof may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified, and no consent may be granted by the Administrative Agent hereunder, except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Majority Lenders; provided that no such waiver and no such amendment, supplement, modification or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by each Lender adversely affected thereby and the Borrower, do any of the following: (i) increase the Commitments of the Lenders or subject the Lenders to any additional obligations, (ii) change the principal of, interest on, or currency of, the Loans or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder (other than waiving the requirement to pay the rate of interest set forth in Section 2.06(b) during the continuation of an Event of Default in connection with the waiver of such Event of Default by the Majority Lenders), (iii) postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Loans, any Note delivered hereunder or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder (other than restoring the schedule for repayment of Loans to the Maturity Date after issuance of a Notice of Cancellation of Acceleration), (iv) amend the definition of “Majority Lenders”, (v) amend, modify or waive Sections 2.07, 9.10 or 9.11, (vi) consent to the assignment or transfer by any Loan Party of any of its rights or Loan Obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or (vii) amend this Section 9.01; and provided further that no   95       amendment, waiver, supplement or modification shall, unless in writing and signed by the applicable Agent, affect the rights or duties of any Agent. Further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.02, if following the Closing Date, the Administrative Agent and any Loan Party shall have jointly identified an obvious error or any error or omission of a technical or immaterial nature, in each case, in any provision of the Loan Documents, then the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Loan Parties shall be permitted to amend such provision and such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to any Loan Documents if the same is not objected to in writing by the Majority Lenders within five (5) Business Days following receipt of notice thereof.

All notices and communications delivered hereunder shall, unless submitted in the English language, be accompanied by a certified English translation thereof, which certified English translation shall (except in the case of laws, regulations or official determinations of any Governmental Authority) be controlling absent manifest error in the case of doubt as to the proper interpretation or construction of the document which it purports to translate.   The Borrower hereby acknowledges that (a) the Administrative Agent will make available to the Lenders materials and/or information provided by or on behalf of the Borrower hereunder (collectively, the “Borrower Materials”) by posting the Borrower Materials on Intralinks, Syndtrak or another similar electronic system (the “Platform”) and (b) certain of the Lenders may be “public-side” Lenders (i.e., Lenders that do not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities) (each, a “Public Lender”). The Borrower, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, hereby agrees that (w) all Borrower Materials that are to be made available to Public Lenders shall be clearly and conspicuously marked “PUBLIC” which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word “PUBLIC” shall appear prominently on the first page thereof; (x) by marking Borrower Materials “PUBLIC,” the Borrower shall be deemed to have authorized the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to treat such Borrower      96       Materials as not containing any material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States federal and state securities laws (provided, however, that to the extent such Borrower Materials constitute information received from the Borrower or its Subsidiaries and related to the Borrower, its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, other than any such information that was available to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to its disclosure by the Borrower or such Subsidiary, they shall be treated as set forth in Section 9.12); (y) all Borrower Materials marked “PUBLIC” are permitted to be made available through a portion of the Platform designated as “Public Investor” (or with a similar designation); and (z) the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to treat any Borrower Materials that are not marked “PUBLIC” as being suitable only for posting on a portion of the Platform not marked as “Public Investor” (or with a similar designation). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following Borrower Materials shall be marked “PUBLIC” unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent and the Lenders promptly that any such document contains material non-public information: (1) the Loan Documents and (2) notification of changes in the terms of the Facility.

No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.   Section","9.04.
