Procedure for Borrowing.  (a) The Borrowing shall be made after irrevocable notice to the \n\nAdministrative Agent and the Lenders. The date of the proposed Borrowing shall be a Business Day. Such irrevocable \n\nnotice of a Borrowing (a “Notice of Borrowing”) shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or \n\nfacsimile, in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto, specifying therein (i) prior to the Closing Date (x) the requested \n\ndate of such Borrowing (which date shall be the Closing Date) and (y) the account in which the proceeds of such \n\nBorrowing are requested to be deposited with the Borrower  \n\n \n33 \n\n  \n    \n\nand (ii) the Interest Period applicable thereto (with respect to the Borrowing as of the Closing Date and the continuation \n\nof a Loan thereafter). Subject to the fulfillment or written waiver of the applicable conditions set forth in Article 4, \n\neach Lender shall make available its applicable portion of such Borrowing (determined ratably in accordance with the \n\nrespective Commitments of the Lenders) in immediately available funds as directed by the Borrower in the Notice of \n\nBorrowing.  \n\n \n(b)         The Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. The Borrower shall \n\nindemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of the non-satisfaction \n\nfor any reason whatsoever on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing of the applicable conditions \n\nfor the making of any Loans set forth in Article 4, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated \n\nprofits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by \n\nsuch Lender to fund such Loan to be made by such Lender as part of the Borrowing requested under such Notice of \n\nBorrowing when such Loan, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.  \n\n \nSection 2.03.   Fees.  (a) Commitment Fee.   On the Closing Date, the Borrower shall pay to Athyrium (or to \n\nthe Administrative Agent for the account of Athyrium), a commitment fee equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal \n\namount of Athyrium’s Commitment.  \n\n \n(b)         Agency Fee.   The Borrower shall pay each Agent an agency fee in the amount set forth in the \n\nAgency Fee Letter dated as of the Closing Date between the Borrower and the Agents, payable in advance on the \n\nClosing Date and on each anniversary of the Closing Date until the Loans have been repaid in full.  \n\n \n(c)         Prepayment Premium.   The Prepayment Premium shall be payable hereunder in respect of any \n\nrepayment (other than on the Maturity Date) or prepayment of the Loans (and any repricing or amendment that \n\neffectively refinances any Loans hereunder) including any optional or mandatory prepayment under Section 2.05 or \n\nfollowing the acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Article 7.  \n\n \nSection 2.04.  Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.  (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to \n\npay to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Account for the ratable account of the Lenders the \n\noutstanding principal amount of the Loans on the Maturity Date.  \n\n \n(b)         Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing \n\nthe indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender  \n\n \n34 \n\n\n\n  \n    \n\nresulting from the Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to \n\nsuch Lender from time to time hereunder.  \n\n \n(c)         The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each \n\nLoan made hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from \n\nthe Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent \n\nhereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.  \n\n \n(d)         The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be \n\nbinding on the Borrower, absent manifest error; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent \n\nto maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay \n\nthe Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  \n\n \n(e)         The Borrower will execute and deliver to each requesting Lender a promissory note of the Borrower \n\nin the amount of any Loans owing to such Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit A with appropriate insertions \n\nas to date and principal amount (a “Note”). The Borrower irrevocably authorizes each Lender to make or cause to be \n\nmade an appropriate notation on the Schedule attached to such Lender’s Note of the making of Loans or the receipt \n\nof payments, but the failure to record, or any error in so recording, any amount of such Loans or payments on such \n\nSchedule shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under any Notes delivered to \n\nsuch Lender to make payments of principal of or interest on the Loans or on such Notes when due.  \n\n \nSection 2.05.   Prepayments.  (a) Optional.  The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to \n\ntime after the Closing Date to prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, upon at least one Business Day’s prior written \n\nnotice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written notice) to the Administrative Agent before 11:00 a.m., New \n\nYork City time; provided, however, that each partial prepayment shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of \n\n$1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000.

The Borrower shall prepay the Loans in accordance with the following:  \n\n \n(i)         If any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries Disposes of any Property (including any \n\nsale or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any of its Capital Stock (other than \n\nDisqualified Capital Stock and any sales or issuances of Capital Stock to another Loan Party))  \n\n    \n\n35 \n\n  \n\n \n(other than any Disposition of any inventory permitted by Section 6.06(a)) which results in the realization by \n\nsuch Person of Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate during the term of this Agreement, \n\nthe Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds \n\nno later than two Business Days following receipt thereof by such Person (such prepayments to be applied \n\nas set forth in clause (iv) below); provided, however, that with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds, at the \n\nelection of the Borrower (as notified by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of \n\nreceipt of such Net Cash Proceeds), and so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and \n\nbe continuing, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary may apply such Net Cash Proceeds to reinvest in the \n\npurchase of capital assets useful in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary, in each case to be \n\nused in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary within 180 days following the date of receipt of \n\nsuch Net Cash Proceeds (or, if within such 180-day period, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary enters into a \n\nbinding commitment to so reinvest such Net Cash Proceeds, within 360 days following the date of receipt of \n\nsuch Net Cash Proceeds); provided, further, that if within such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-\n\nday) period after the date of receipt by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary of such Net Cash Proceeds, such \n\n\n\nLoan Party or such Subsidiary has not so used all or a portion of such Net Cash Proceeds otherwise required \n\nto be applied as a mandatory repayment pursuant to this Section 2.05(b)(i), the remaining portion of such Net \n\nCash Proceeds shall be applied as a mandatory repayment in accordance with the requirements of this Section \n\n2.05(b)(i) on the last day of such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period.  \n\n \n(ii)         Within two Business Days following any Extraordinary Receipt received by or paid to \n\nor for the account of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate during \n\nthe term of this Agreement, and not otherwise included in this Section 2.05(b), the Borrower shall prepay an \n\naggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom by such \n\nLoan Party or such Subsidiary (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clause (iv) below); provided, \n\nhowever, that with respect to such Extraordinary Receipts, at the election of the Borrower (as notified by the \n\nBorrower to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of receipt of such Extraordinary Receipts), and \n\nso long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such Loan Party or such \n\nSubsidiary may apply such Extraordinary Receipts to reinvest in the purchase of assets useful in the business \n\nof such Loan Party or such Subsidiary, in each case to be used in the business of such Loan Party or such \n\nSubsidiary within 180-days following the date of receipt of such Extraordinary  \n\n    \n\n36 \n\n  \n    \n\nReceipts (or, if within such 180-day period, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary enters into a binding \n\ncommitment to so reinvest such Extraordinary Receipts, within 360 days following the date of receipt of such \n\nExtraordinary Receipts); provided, further, that if within such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) \n\nperiod after the date of receipt by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary of such Extraordinary Receipts, such \n\nLoan Party or such Subsidiary has not so used all or a portion of such Extraordinary Receipts otherwise \n\nrequired to be applied as a mandatory repayment pursuant to this sentence, the remaining portion of such \n\nExtraordinary Receipts shall be applied as a mandatory repayment in accordance with the requirements of \n\nthis Section 2.05(b)(ii) on the last day of such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period.  \n\n \n(iii)         Upon the incurrence or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any \n\nIndebtedness (other than Indebtedness expressly permitted to be incurred or issued pursuant to Section 6.01), \n\nthe Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds \n\nreceived therefrom no later than two Business Days following receipt thereof by such Loan Party or such \n\nSubsidiary (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clauses (iv) and (v) below).  \n\n \n(iv)         Each prepayment of Loans pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05(b) \n\nshall be shared among the Lenders ratably.  \n\n \n(c)         All prepayments of Loans under this Section 2.05 (and any repricing or amendment that effectively \n\nrefinances any Loans hereunder), shall be made in an amount equal to the sum of (x) 100% of the principal amount of \n\nsuch Loans being prepaid (or repriced or effectively refinanced) plus (y) all accrued and unpaid interest on the amount \n\nof principal of such Loans being prepaid (or repriced or effectively refinanced) to but excluding the date of such \n\nprepayment (or repricing or refinancing) plus (z) the applicable Prepayment Premium. No amounts repaid hereunder \n\nmay be reborrowed.  \n\n \nSection 2.06.  Interest Rates and Payment Dates.  (a) Except as provided in Section 2.06(b), (x) each LIBOR \n\nRate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from and including the date of such LIBOR Rate \n\nLoan to and excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full, at a rate per annum which shall, during \n\neach Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Adjusted LIBOR Rate \n\nfor such Interest Period and (y) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from \n\nand including the date of such Base Rate Loan to and excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full, \n\nat a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate. Accrued interest on each Loan shall \n\nbe payable in arrears in cash on each Interest Payment Date.  \n\n    \n\n37 \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n(b)         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default under Section 7.01(a) or Section \n\n7.01(g), the Borrower shall pay interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Loan owing to each Lender, payable \n\nin arrears on the dates and in the manner referred to in clause (a) above, and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at \n\nall times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Loan pursuant to clause (a) above; \n\nand (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount payable under the Loan \n\nDocuments that is not paid when due, from the date such amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full, \n\npayable in arrears on the date such amount shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times \n\nto 2% per annum above the rate per annum that would be required to be paid at such time in respect of such amounts.  \n\n \nSection 2.07.

(a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under \n\nthe Notes, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 2:00 p.m. on the day when due in U.S. \n\nDollars to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Account, in same day funds, with payments being \n\nreceived by the Administrative Agent after such time being deemed to have been received on the next succeeding \n\nBusiness Day. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the \n\npayment of principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08) to the Lenders \n\nfor the account of their respective Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable \n\nto any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the \n\nterms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information \n\ncontained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.06(d), from and after the effective date of such Assignment and \n\nAcceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes in respect of the interest \n\nassigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make \n\nall appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.  \n\n \n(b)         All computations of interest and of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a \n\nyear of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) \n\noccurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent \n\nof an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  \n\n \n(c)         Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a \n\nBusiness Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in \n\nsuch case be included in the computation of payment of interest.  \n\n    \n\n38 \n\n  \n    \n\n(d)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on \n\nwhich any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the \n\nAdministrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on \n\nsuch date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such \n\nLender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower \n\nshall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the \n\nAdministrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for \n\neach day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to \n\nthe Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.  \n\n \n(e)         The Loan Parties’ obligation to pay all amounts due hereunder and under any other Loan Documents \n\nshall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including:  \n\n \n(i)         any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, deduction, abatement, suspension, diminution, \n\nreduction, defense or other right which any Loan Party may have against any supplier, whether such supplier \n\nwas paid from the proceeds of Loans or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever arising under or pursuant to \n\nany supply agreement or otherwise relating to the purchase of goods, other property or services from or by \n\nany such supplier;  \n\n\n\n \n(ii)         any defect in the condition, design, operation, or fitness for use of, or any damage to \n\nor loss or destruction of, any equipment or material provided by any such supplier;  \n\n \n(iii)         any actual or alleged default by any such supplier or any other Person under any \n\nsupply agreement; or  \n\n \n(iv)         any other fact or circumstance relating to any supply agreement.  \n\n \nSection 2.08. Taxes. (a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any \n\nobligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or \n\nwithholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings \n\nor other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, \n\nadditions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be \n\nrequired by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case \n\nmay be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender  \n\n    \n\n39 \n\n  \n    \n\nor the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party \n\nshall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made \n\nall required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable \n\nunder this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the \n\nsum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all \n\nsuch deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant \n\nGovernmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  \n\n \n(b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or \n\nfuture stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or \n\nfrom the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a \n\nsecurity interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).  \n\n \n(c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them \n\nharmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent \n\n(as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such \n\nIndemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This \n\nindemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may \n\nbe) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the \n\nBorrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or \n\non behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  \n\n \nEach Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for \n\n(i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already \n\nindemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure \n\nto comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) \n\nany Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in \n\nconnection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not \n\nsuch Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from \n\nthe Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent \n\nmanifest error.  \n\n    \n\n40 \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n(d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the \n\nAdministrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such \n\nother evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.  \n\n \n(e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding \n\nTax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative \n\nAgent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly \n\ncompleted and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will \n\npermit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if \n\nreasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed \n\nby applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower \n\nor the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information \n\nreporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, \n\nexecution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), \n\n(ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or \n\nsubmission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice \n\nthe legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender \n\nthat is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such \n\nLender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the \n\nBorrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt \n\nfrom U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, \n\ndeliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) \n\non or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is \n\napplicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States \n\nis a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-\n\n8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the \n\n“interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, \n\nIRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\npursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)  \n\n    \n\n41 \n\n  \n\n \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption \n\nfor portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the \n\neffect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent \n\nshareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign \n\ncorporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed \n\noriginals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a \n\nU.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other \n\ncertification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership \n\nand one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such \n\nForeign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of \n\neach such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver \n\nto the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or \n\nprior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other \n\nform prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding \n\nTax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to \n\npermit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and \n\n(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\n\n\nimposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA \n\n(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the \n\nBorrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably \n\nrequested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including \n\nas prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by \n\nthe Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to \n\ncomply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s \n\nobligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes \n\nof this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be \n\nrequired by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case \n\nmay be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender  \n\n    \n\n39 \n\n  \n    \n\nor the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party \n\nshall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made \n\nall required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable \n\nunder this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the \n\nsum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all \n\nsuch deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant \n\nGovernmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  \n\n \n(b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or \n\nfuture stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or \n\nfrom the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a \n\nsecurity interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).  \n\n \n(c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them \n\nharmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent \n\n(as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such \n\nIndemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This \n\nindemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may \n\nbe) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the \n\nBorrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or \n\non behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  \n\n \nEach Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for \n\n(i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already \n\nindemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure \n\nto comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) \n\nany Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in \n\nconnection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not \n\nsuch Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from \n\nthe Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent \n\nmanifest error.  \n\n    \n\n40 \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n(d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the \n\nAdministrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such \n\nother evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.  \n\n \n(e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding \n\nTax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative \n\nAgent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly \n\ncompleted and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will \n\npermit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if \n\nreasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed \n\nby applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower \n\nor the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information \n\nreporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, \n\nexecution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), \n\n(ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or \n\nsubmission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice \n\nthe legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender \n\nthat is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such \n\nLender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the \n\nBorrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt \n\nfrom U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, \n\ndeliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) \n\non or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is \n\napplicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States \n\nis a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-\n\n8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the \n\n“interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, \n\nIRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\npursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)  \n\n    \n\n41 \n\n  \n\n \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption \n\nfor portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the \n\neffect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent \n\nshareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign \n\ncorporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed \n\noriginals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a \n\nU.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other \n\ncertification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership \n\nand one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such \n\nForeign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of \n\neach such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver \n\nto the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or \n\nprior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other \n\nform prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding \n\nTax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to \n\npermit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and \n\n(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\n\n\nimposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA \n\n(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the \n\nBorrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably \n\nrequested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including \n\nas prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by \n\nthe Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to \n\ncomply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s \n\nobligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes \n\nof this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each \n\nLender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any \n\nrespect, it shall update  \n\n    \n\n42 \n\n  \n    \n\nsuch form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability \n\nto do so.  \n\n \nSection 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to \n\nany Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender \n\nshall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to \n\nassign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such \n\nLender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the \n\nfuture, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be \n\ndisadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in \n\nconnection with any such designation or assignment.  \n\n \nSection 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether \n\nvoluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it \n\n(other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the \n\nLoans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in \n\nthe Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably \n\nwith each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such \n\npurchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing \n\nLender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share \n\n(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered \n\nfrom the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of \n\nthe total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender \n\npursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including \n\nthe right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower \n\nor a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.  \n\n \nSection 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an \n\ninducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders \n\nits warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to \n\nadjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to \n\nbe substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, \n\nor delivered in substitution or exchange for  \n\n \n43 \n\n  \n    \n\nany thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to \n\nthe contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable \n\n(subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of \n\n\n\nthe Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each \n\ncase immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  \n\n \n(b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower \n\nwill issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each \n\nWarrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the \n\nClosing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder \n\na Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants \n\nto be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased \n\nby such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such \n\nWarrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such \n\nnotice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants \n\ndeliverable to such Warrantholder).  \n\n \n(c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-\n\n2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal \n\namount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue \n\nprice allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue \n\nprice and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated \n\nhereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent \n\njurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.  \n\n \nSection 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any \n\nGovernmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority \n\nof such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice \n\nthereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or \n\ncontinue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such  \n\n \n44 \n\n  \n\n \nLender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such \n\nLender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid \n\nsuch illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the \n\nBase Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain \n\nsuch LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such \n\nLIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates \n\nbased upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base \n\nRate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative \n\nAgent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the \n\namount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.  \n\n \nSection 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a \n\ncontinuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks \n\nin the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and \n\nreasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the \n\naffected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR \n\nRate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation \n\nof the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such \n\n\n\nnotice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).  \n\n \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in \n\nclause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with \n\nrespect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the \n\nImpacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected \n\nLenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and \n\nfairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has \n\nmade it unlawful, or that  \n\n \n45 \n\n  \n\n \nany Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine \n\nor charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the \n\nauthority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written \n\nnotice thereof.  \n\n \nSection 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change \n\nin Law shall:  \n\n \n(i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance \n\ncharge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or \n\nparticipated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;  \n\n \n(ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified \n\nTaxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection \n\nIncome Taxes); or  \n\n \n(iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense \n\naffecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or \n\nparticipation therein;  \n\n \nand the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing \n\nor maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case \n\nof clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such \n\nLender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, \n\ninterest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional \n\namount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  \n\n \n(b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or \n\nany Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity \n\nrequirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of \n\nsuch Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the \n\nLoans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have \n\nachieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such \n\nLender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such \n\nLender  \n\n \n46 \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\nsuch additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such \n\nreduction suffered.  \n\n \n(c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts \n\nnecessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) \n\nof this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such \n\nLender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.  \n\n \n(d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to \n\nthe foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such \n\ncompensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing \n\nprovisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the \n\ndate that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and \n\nof such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such \n\nincreased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include \n\nthe period of retroactive effect thereof).  \n\n \nSection 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative \n\nAgent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless \n\nfrom any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:  \n\n \n(a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of \n\nthe Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);  \n\n \n(b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to \n\nprepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or  \n\n \n(c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of \n\na request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;  \n\n \nexcluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment \n\nof funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds \n\nwere obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender \n\nin connection with the foregoing.  \n\n   \n\n47 \n\n  \n\n \nFor purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender \n\nshall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other \n\nborrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether \n\nor not such Loan was in fact so funded.  \n\n \nSection 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the \n\nBorrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental \n\nAuthority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is \n\nunable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender \n\nin accordance with Section 9.13.  \n\n \nSection 2.17.   Survival.   Each party’s obligations under Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 \n\nshall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Loan Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan \n\nDocuments, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.  \n\n \n\n\n\nArticle 3 \n\nRepresentations and Warranties  \n\n \nRepresentations and Warranties of the Borrower. In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent \n\nto enter into this Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make the Loans hereunder, the Borrower makes the following \n\nrepresentations and warranties as to itself and its Subsidiaries:  \n\n \nSection 3.01.   Existence and Power.   The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited \n\nliability company or limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its \n\njurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to do business in each additional jurisdiction necessary or advisable \n\nfor the conduct of its business, except for such failures to so qualify in such additional jurisdictions as would not, \n\nindividually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and each of \n\nits Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to own its Properties and to carry on its business as now being \n\nconducted and as proposed to be conducted. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational \n\npower to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants \n\nand the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower has all requisite organizational power to borrow \n\nthe Loans and issue the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Lenders and Warrantholders in accordance with \n\nthe terms hereof and thereof.  \n\n \n48 \n\n  \n    \n\nSection 3.02.

(a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under \n\nthe Notes, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 2:00 p.m. on the day when due in U.S. \n\nDollars to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Account, in same day funds, with payments being \n\nreceived by the Administrative Agent after such time being deemed to have been received on the next succeeding \n\nBusiness Day. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the \n\npayment of principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08) to the Lenders \n\nfor the account of their respective Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable \n\nto any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the \n\nterms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information \n\ncontained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.06(d), from and after the effective date of such Assignment and \n\nAcceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes in respect of the interest \n\nassigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make \n\nall appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.  \n\n \n(b)         All computations of interest and of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a \n\nyear of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) \n\noccurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent \n\nof an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  \n\n \n(c)         Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a \n\nBusiness Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in \n\nsuch case be included in the computation of payment of interest.  \n\n    \n\n38 \n\n  \n    \n\n(d)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on \n\nwhich any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the \n\nAdministrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on \n\nsuch date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such \n\nLender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower \n\nshall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the \n\nAdministrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for \n\neach day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to \n\nthe Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.  \n\n \n(e)         The Loan Parties’ obligation to pay all amounts due hereunder and under any other Loan Documents \n\nshall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including:  \n\n \n(i)         any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, deduction, abatement, suspension, diminution, \n\nreduction, defense or other right which any Loan Party may have against any supplier, whether such supplier \n\nwas paid from the proceeds of Loans or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever arising under or pursuant to \n\nany supply agreement or otherwise relating to the purchase of goods, other property or services from or by \n\nany such supplier;  \n\n\n\n \n(ii)         any defect in the condition, design, operation, or fitness for use of, or any damage to \n\nor loss or destruction of, any equipment or material provided by any such supplier;  \n\n \n(iii)         any actual or alleged default by any such supplier or any other Person under any \n\nsupply agreement; or  \n\n \n(iv)         any other fact or circumstance relating to any supply agreement.  \n\n \nSection 2.08. Taxes. (a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any \n\nobligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or \n\nwithholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings \n\nor other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, \n\nadditions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be \n\nrequired by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case \n\nmay be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender  \n\n    \n\n39 \n\n  \n    \n\nor the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party \n\nshall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made \n\nall required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable \n\nunder this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the \n\nsum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all \n\nsuch deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant \n\nGovernmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  \n\n \n(b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or \n\nfuture stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or \n\nfrom the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a \n\nsecurity interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).  \n\n \n(c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them \n\nharmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent \n\n(as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such \n\nIndemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This \n\nindemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may \n\nbe) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the \n\nBorrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or \n\non behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  \n\n \nEach Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for \n\n(i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already \n\nindemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure \n\nto comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) \n\nany Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in \n\nconnection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not \n\nsuch Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from \n\nthe Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent \n\nmanifest error.  \n\n    \n\n40 \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n(d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the \n\nAdministrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such \n\nother evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.  \n\n \n(e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding \n\nTax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative \n\nAgent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly \n\ncompleted and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will \n\npermit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if \n\nreasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed \n\nby applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower \n\nor the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information \n\nreporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, \n\nexecution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), \n\n(ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or \n\nsubmission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice \n\nthe legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender \n\nthat is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such \n\nLender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the \n\nBorrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt \n\nfrom U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, \n\ndeliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) \n\non or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is \n\napplicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States \n\nis a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-\n\n8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the \n\n“interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, \n\nIRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\npursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)  \n\n    \n\n41 \n\n  \n\n \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption \n\nfor portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the \n\neffect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent \n\nshareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign \n\ncorporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed \n\noriginals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a \n\nU.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other \n\ncertification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership \n\nand one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such \n\nForeign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of \n\neach such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver \n\nto the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or \n\nprior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other \n\nform prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding \n\nTax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to \n\npermit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and \n\n(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\n\n\nimposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA \n\n(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the \n\nBorrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably \n\nrequested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including \n\nas prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by \n\nthe Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to \n\ncomply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s \n\nobligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes \n\nof this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each \n\nLender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any \n\nrespect, it shall update  \n\n    \n\n42 \n\n  \n    \n\nsuch form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability \n\nto do so.  \n\n \nSection 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to \n\nany Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender \n\nshall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to \n\nassign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such \n\nLender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the \n\nfuture, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be \n\ndisadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in \n\nconnection with any such designation or assignment.  \n\n \nSection 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether \n\nvoluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it \n\n(other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the \n\nLoans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in \n\nthe Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably \n\nwith each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such \n\npurchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing \n\nLender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share \n\n(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered \n\nfrom the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of \n\nthe total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender \n\npursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including \n\nthe right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower \n\nor a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.  \n\n \nSection 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an \n\ninducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders \n\nits warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to \n\nadjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to \n\nbe substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, \n\nor delivered in substitution or exchange for  \n\n \n43 \n\n  \n    \n\nany thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to \n\nthe contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable \n\n(subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of \n\n\n\nthe Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each \n\ncase immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  \n\n \n(b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower \n\nwill issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each \n\nWarrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the \n\nClosing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder \n\na Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants \n\nto be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased \n\nby such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such \n\nWarrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such \n\nnotice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants \n\ndeliverable to such Warrantholder).  \n\n \n(c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-\n\n2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal \n\namount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue \n\nprice allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue \n\nprice and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated \n\nhereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent \n\njurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.  \n\n \nSection 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any \n\nGovernmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority \n\nof such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice \n\nthereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or \n\ncontinue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such  \n\n \n44 \n\n  \n\n \nLender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such \n\nLender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid \n\nsuch illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the \n\nBase Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain \n\nsuch LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such \n\nLIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates \n\nbased upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base \n\nRate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative \n\nAgent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the \n\namount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.  \n\n \nSection 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a \n\ncontinuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks \n\nin the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and \n\nreasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the \n\naffected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR \n\nRate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation \n\nof the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such \n\n\n\nnotice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).  \n\n \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in \n\nclause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with \n\nrespect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the \n\nImpacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected \n\nLenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and \n\nfairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has \n\nmade it unlawful, or that  \n\n \n45 \n\n  \n\n \nany Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine \n\nor charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the \n\nauthority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written \n\nnotice thereof.  \n\n \nSection 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change \n\nin Law shall:  \n\n \n(i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance \n\ncharge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or \n\nparticipated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;  \n\n \n(ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified \n\nTaxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection \n\nIncome Taxes); or  \n\n \n(iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense \n\naffecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or \n\nparticipation therein;  \n\n \nand the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing \n\nor maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case \n\nof clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such \n\nLender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, \n\ninterest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional \n\namount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  \n\n \n(b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or \n\nany Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity \n\nrequirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of \n\nsuch Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the \n\nLoans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have \n\nachieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such \n\nLender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such \n\nLender  \n\n \n46 \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\nsuch additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such \n\nreduction suffered.  \n\n \n(c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts \n\nnecessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) \n\nof this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such \n\nLender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.  \n\n \n(d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to \n\nthe foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such \n\ncompensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing \n\nprovisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the \n\ndate that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and \n\nof such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such \n\nincreased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include \n\nthe period of retroactive effect thereof).  \n\n \nSection 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative \n\nAgent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless \n\nfrom any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:  \n\n \n(a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of \n\nthe Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);  \n\n \n(b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to \n\nprepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or  \n\n \n(c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of \n\na request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;  \n\n \nexcluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment \n\nof funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds \n\nwere obtained.

Business Operations and Other Information;   Financial Condition; No Material Adverse \n\nEffect. (a) The Borrower has heretofore delivered or caused to be delivered to each Lender copies of the Audited \n\nFinancial Statements (the “Financial Statements”). The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with \n\nGAAP (except as otherwise noted therein), consistently applied, and subject, in the case of each of the Financial \n\nStatements that are unaudited, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes, and \n\npresent fairly in all material respects the Consolidated financial position and related Consolidated income, \n\nstockholders’ equity and cash flows (as applicable) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at each of the dates and for \n\neach of the periods respectively covered thereby.  \n\n \n(b)          As of December 31, 2013, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries had any Indebtedness or \n\nliability, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or any Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities, \n\nliabilities for material taxes, long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, except as reflected or \n\nreserved against on the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements or described in the notes thereto.  \n\n \n(c)          Attached as Schedule 3.05(c) is a copy of the latest (as of the Closing Date) projections of the \n\nconsolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flow of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (assuming \n\nconsummation of the Transactions) for each of the fiscal years of the Borrower in the period from the Closing Date \n\nthrough 2015, including a detailed cash flow forecast for the 12-month period following the Closing Date. Such \n\nprojections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light \n\nof current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future \n\nfinancial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being \n\nacknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may \n\ncause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.  \n\n \n50 \n\n  \n    \n\n(d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of \n\nthe Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of \n\nthe historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been \n\ncompleted immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then \n\nended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial \n\nposition and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of \n\nbusiness on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date \n\nor at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to \n\nfairly reflect such assumptions.  \n\n \n(e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or \n\nwhich could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event \n\nwhich individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a \n\nDefault or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  \n\n \n\n\n\nSection 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.

No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and \n\nits Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, \n\nissuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or  \n\n \n51 \n\n  \n\n \ncompliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the \n\nconsummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or \n\nprovisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to \n\nthe Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the \n\nOrganizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.  \n\n \nSection 3.08.

Outstanding Indebtedness.   Schedule 6.01(a) sets forth a correct and complete list and brief \n\ndescription of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness evidenced by the \n\nLoans) existing on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, in each case showing the aggregate \n\nprincipal amount thereof (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn commitments with respect thereto), the name of \n\nthe respective borrower and any other entity which directly or indirectly guarantees such debt and all Liens securing \n\nsuch Indebtedness.  \n\n \nSection 3.10.   Taxes.  The Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, has timely filed all U.S. federal \n\nand all material state, local and foreign tax returns, information returns and excise tax returns, forms and reports for \n\nTaxes (“Tax Returns”) with the appropriate Governmental Authority which were or are required to have been filed \n\nby or on behalf of any such Persons and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and accurately reflect in \n\n\n\nall material respects all liability for Taxes of the Borrower or Subsidiary taken as a whole for the periods covered \n\nthereby. All Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other material Taxes and assessments payable \n\nby the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof have been timely paid to the appropriate Governmental  \n\n    \n\n52 \n\n  \n    \n\nAuthority, unless such Tax liability is being diligently contested in good faith and the Borrower and/or the appropriate \n\nSubsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, has adequately reserved against such Tax liability on its books and financial \n\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted \n\nwith respect to any such Taxes as of the date hereof. No material Tax assessment against the Borrower, or any \n\nSubsidiary thereof has been proposed, formally or informally. The Tax liabilities of the Borrower and any Subsidiary \n\nthereof are adequately provided for on the relevant Person’s books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP.  \n\n \nSection 3.11.   Disclosure.   None of this Agreement nor any other document or certificate furnished to any \n\nLender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith (including the Financial \n\nStatements), taken in the aggregate, contained, as of its respective date and as of the Closing Date, and no document \n\nor certificate which shall be furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in \n\nconnection herewith, when taken as a whole with, all documents and certificates previously delivered, shall contain, \n\nas of its date of delivery, any untrue statement of a material fact, or as of any such date omitted to state a material fact \n\nnecessary in order to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they \n\nwere made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents \n\nonly that such information was prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it \n\nbeing acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which \n\nmay cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary from the projected results. Neither the \n\nBorrower nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any facts (other than matters of a general economic or political nature) \n\nthat individually or in the aggregate have had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \nSection 3.12.    Margin Regulations.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or intends to \n\nacquire any “margin stock” as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of \n\nthe United States (12 CFR 207).

The aggregate unfunded \n\nliabilities with respect to Foreign Pension Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect \n\nassuming proper funding and administration of such foreign Pension Plans on an ongoing basis.  \n\n \nSection 3.14.     Labor Matters.   As of the date hereof and the Closing Date, there are no strikes, lockouts or \n\nslowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge the Borrower, threatened.

The Borrower irrevocably authorizes each Lender to make or cause to be \n\nmade an appropriate notation on the Schedule attached to such Lender’s Note of the making of Loans or the receipt \n\nof payments, but the failure to record, or any error in so recording, any amount of such Loans or payments on such \n\nSchedule shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under any Notes delivered to \n\nsuch Lender to make payments of principal of or interest on the Loans or on such Notes when due.  \n\n \nSection 2.05.   Prepayments.  (a) Optional.  The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to \n\ntime after the Closing Date to prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, upon at least one Business Day’s prior written \n\nnotice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written notice) to the Administrative Agent before 11:00 a.m., New \n\nYork City time; provided, however, that each partial prepayment shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of \n\n$1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000.

The Borrower shall prepay the Loans in accordance with the following:  \n\n \n(i)         If any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries Disposes of any Property (including any \n\nsale or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any of its Capital Stock (other than \n\nDisqualified Capital Stock and any sales or issuances of Capital Stock to another Loan Party))  \n\n    \n\n35 \n\n  \n\n \n(other than any Disposition of any inventory permitted by Section 6.06(a)) which results in the realization by \n\nsuch Person of Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate during the term of this Agreement, \n\nthe Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds \n\nno later than two Business Days following receipt thereof by such Person (such prepayments to be applied \n\nas set forth in clause (iv) below); provided, however, that with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds, at the \n\nelection of the Borrower (as notified by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of \n\nreceipt of such Net Cash Proceeds), and so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and \n\nbe continuing, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary may apply such Net Cash Proceeds to reinvest in the \n\npurchase of capital assets useful in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary, in each case to be \n\nused in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary within 180 days following the date of receipt of \n\nsuch Net Cash Proceeds (or, if within such 180-day period, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary enters into a \n\nbinding commitment to so reinvest such Net Cash Proceeds, within 360 days following the date of receipt of \n\nsuch Net Cash Proceeds); provided, further, that if within such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-\n\nday) period after the date of receipt by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary of such Net Cash Proceeds, such \n\n\n\nLoan Party or such Subsidiary has not so used all or a portion of such Net Cash Proceeds otherwise required \n\nto be applied as a mandatory repayment pursuant to this Section 2.05(b)(i), the remaining portion of such Net \n\nCash Proceeds shall be applied as a mandatory repayment in accordance with the requirements of this Section \n\n2.05(b)(i) on the last day of such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period.  \n\n \n(ii)         Within two Business Days following any Extraordinary Receipt received by or paid to \n\nor for the account of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate during \n\nthe term of this Agreement, and not otherwise included in this Section 2.05(b), the Borrower shall prepay an \n\naggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom by such \n\nLoan Party or such Subsidiary (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clause (iv) below); provided, \n\nhowever, that with respect to such Extraordinary Receipts, at the election of the Borrower (as notified by the \n\nBorrower to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of receipt of such Extraordinary Receipts), and \n\nso long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such Loan Party or such \n\nSubsidiary may apply such Extraordinary Receipts to reinvest in the purchase of assets useful in the business \n\nof such Loan Party or such Subsidiary, in each case to be used in the business of such Loan Party or such \n\nSubsidiary within 180-days following the date of receipt of such Extraordinary  \n\n    \n\n36 \n\n  \n    \n\nReceipts (or, if within such 180-day period, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary enters into a binding \n\ncommitment to so reinvest such Extraordinary Receipts, within 360 days following the date of receipt of such \n\nExtraordinary Receipts); provided, further, that if within such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) \n\nperiod after the date of receipt by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary of such Extraordinary Receipts, such \n\nLoan Party or such Subsidiary has not so used all or a portion of such Extraordinary Receipts otherwise \n\nrequired to be applied as a mandatory repayment pursuant to this sentence, the remaining portion of such \n\nExtraordinary Receipts shall be applied as a mandatory repayment in accordance with the requirements of \n\nthis Section 2.05(b)(ii) on the last day of such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period.  \n\n \n(iii)         Upon the incurrence or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any \n\nIndebtedness (other than Indebtedness expressly permitted to be incurred or issued pursuant to Section 6.01), \n\nthe Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds \n\nreceived therefrom no later than two Business Days following receipt thereof by such Loan Party or such \n\nSubsidiary (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clauses (iv) and (v) below).  \n\n \n(iv)         Each prepayment of Loans pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05(b) \n\nshall be shared among the Lenders ratably.  \n\n \n(c)         All prepayments of Loans under this Section 2.05 (and any repricing or amendment that effectively \n\nrefinances any Loans hereunder), shall be made in an amount equal to the sum of (x) 100% of the principal amount of \n\nsuch Loans being prepaid (or repriced or effectively refinanced) plus (y) all accrued and unpaid interest on the amount \n\nof principal of such Loans being prepaid (or repriced or effectively refinanced) to but excluding the date of such \n\nprepayment (or repricing or refinancing) plus (z) the applicable Prepayment Premium. No amounts repaid hereunder \n\nmay be reborrowed.  \n\n \nSection 2.06.  Interest Rates and Payment Dates.  (a) Except as provided in Section 2.06(b), (x) each LIBOR \n\nRate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from and including the date of such LIBOR Rate \n\nLoan to and excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full, at a rate per annum which shall, during \n\neach Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Adjusted LIBOR Rate \n\nfor such Interest Period and (y) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from \n\nand including the date of such Base Rate Loan to and excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full, \n\nat a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate. Accrued interest on each Loan shall \n\nbe payable in arrears in cash on each Interest Payment Date.  \n\n    \n\n37 \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n(b)         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default under Section 7.01(a) or Section \n\n7.01(g), the Borrower shall pay interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Loan owing to each Lender, payable \n\nin arrears on the dates and in the manner referred to in clause (a) above, and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at \n\nall times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Loan pursuant to clause (a) above; \n\nand (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount payable under the Loan \n\nDocuments that is not paid when due, from the date such amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full, \n\npayable in arrears on the date such amount shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times \n\nto 2% per annum above the rate per annum that would be required to be paid at such time in respect of such amounts.  \n\n \nSection 2.07.

(a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under \n\nthe Notes, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 2:00 p.m. on the day when due in U.S. \n\nDollars to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Account, in same day funds, with payments being \n\nreceived by the Administrative Agent after such time being deemed to have been received on the next succeeding \n\nBusiness Day. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the \n\npayment of principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08) to the Lenders \n\nfor the account of their respective Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable \n\nto any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the \n\nterms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information \n\ncontained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.06(d), from and after the effective date of such Assignment and \n\nAcceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes in respect of the interest \n\nassigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make \n\nall appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.  \n\n \n(b)         All computations of interest and of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a \n\nyear of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) \n\noccurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent \n\nof an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  \n\n \n(c)         Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a \n\nBusiness Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in \n\nsuch case be included in the computation of payment of interest.  \n\n    \n\n38 \n\n  \n    \n\n(d)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on \n\nwhich any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the \n\nAdministrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on \n\nsuch date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such \n\nLender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower \n\nshall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the \n\nAdministrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for \n\neach day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to \n\nthe Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.  \n\n \n(e)         The Loan Parties’ obligation to pay all amounts due hereunder and under any other Loan Documents \n\nshall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including:  \n\n \n(i)         any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, deduction, abatement, suspension, diminution, \n\nreduction, defense or other right which any Loan Party may have against any supplier, whether such supplier \n\nwas paid from the proceeds of Loans or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever arising under or pursuant to \n\nany supply agreement or otherwise relating to the purchase of goods, other property or services from or by \n\nany such supplier;  \n\n\n\n \n(ii)         any defect in the condition, design, operation, or fitness for use of, or any damage to \n\nor loss or destruction of, any equipment or material provided by any such supplier;  \n\n \n(iii)         any actual or alleged default by any such supplier or any other Person under any \n\nsupply agreement; or  \n\n \n(iv)         any other fact or circumstance relating to any supply agreement.  \n\n \nSection 2.08. Taxes. (a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any \n\nobligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or \n\nwithholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings \n\nor other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, \n\nadditions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be \n\nrequired by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case \n\nmay be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender  \n\n    \n\n39 \n\n  \n    \n\nor the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party \n\nshall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made \n\nall required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable \n\nunder this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the \n\nsum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all \n\nsuch deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant \n\nGovernmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  \n\n \n(b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or \n\nfuture stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or \n\nfrom the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a \n\nsecurity interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).  \n\n \n(c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them \n\nharmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent \n\n(as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such \n\nIndemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This \n\nindemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may \n\nbe) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the \n\nBorrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or \n\non behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  \n\n \nEach Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for \n\n(i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already \n\nindemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure \n\nto comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) \n\nany Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in \n\nconnection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not \n\nsuch Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from \n\nthe Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent \n\nmanifest error.  \n\n    \n\n40 \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n(d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the \n\nAdministrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such \n\nother evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.  \n\n \n(e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding \n\nTax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative \n\nAgent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly \n\ncompleted and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will \n\npermit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if \n\nreasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed \n\nby applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower \n\nor the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information \n\nreporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, \n\nexecution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), \n\n(ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or \n\nsubmission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice \n\nthe legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender \n\nthat is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such \n\nLender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the \n\nBorrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt \n\nfrom U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, \n\ndeliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) \n\non or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is \n\napplicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States \n\nis a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-\n\n8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the \n\n“interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, \n\nIRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\npursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)  \n\n    \n\n41 \n\n  \n\n \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption \n\nfor portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the \n\neffect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent \n\nshareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign \n\ncorporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed \n\noriginals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a \n\nU.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other \n\ncertification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership \n\nand one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such \n\nForeign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of \n\neach such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver \n\nto the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or \n\nprior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other \n\nform prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding \n\nTax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to \n\npermit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and \n\n(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\n\n\nimposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA \n\n(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the \n\nBorrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably \n\nrequested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including \n\nas prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by \n\nthe Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to \n\ncomply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s \n\nobligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes \n\nof this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each \n\nLender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any \n\nrespect, it shall update  \n\n    \n\n42 \n\n  \n    \n\nsuch form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability \n\nto do so.  \n\n \nSection 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to \n\nany Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender \n\nshall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to \n\nassign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such \n\nLender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the \n\nfuture, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be \n\ndisadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in \n\nconnection with any such designation or assignment.  \n\n \nSection 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether \n\nvoluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it \n\n(other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the \n\nLoans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in \n\nthe Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably \n\nwith each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such \n\npurchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing \n\nLender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share \n\n(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered \n\nfrom the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of \n\nthe total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender \n\npursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including \n\nthe right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower \n\nor a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.  \n\n \nSection 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an \n\ninducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders \n\nits warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to \n\nadjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to \n\nbe substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, \n\nor delivered in substitution or exchange for  \n\n \n43 \n\n  \n    \n\nany thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to \n\nthe contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable \n\n(subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of \n\n\n\nthe Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each \n\ncase immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  \n\n \n(b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower \n\nwill issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each \n\nWarrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the \n\nClosing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder \n\na Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants \n\nto be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased \n\nby such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such \n\nWarrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such \n\nnotice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants \n\ndeliverable to such Warrantholder).  \n\n \n(c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-\n\n2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal \n\namount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue \n\nprice allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue \n\nprice and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated \n\nhereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent \n\njurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.  \n\n \nSection 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any \n\nGovernmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority \n\nof such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice \n\nthereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or \n\ncontinue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such  \n\n \n44 \n\n  \n\n \nLender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such \n\nLender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid \n\nsuch illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the \n\nBase Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain \n\nsuch LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such \n\nLIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates \n\nbased upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base \n\nRate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative \n\nAgent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the \n\namount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.  \n\n \nSection 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a \n\ncontinuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks \n\nin the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and \n\nreasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the \n\naffected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR \n\nRate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation \n\nof the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such \n\n\n\nnotice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).  \n\n \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in \n\nclause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with \n\nrespect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the \n\nImpacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected \n\nLenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and \n\nfairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has \n\nmade it unlawful, or that  \n\n \n45 \n\n  \n\n \nany Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine \n\nor charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the \n\nauthority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written \n\nnotice thereof.  \n\n \nSection 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change \n\nin Law shall:  \n\n \n(i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance \n\ncharge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or \n\nparticipated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;  \n\n \n(ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified \n\nTaxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection \n\nIncome Taxes); or  \n\n \n(iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense \n\naffecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or \n\nparticipation therein;  \n\n \nand the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing \n\nor maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case \n\nof clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such \n\nLender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, \n\ninterest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional \n\namount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  \n\n \n(b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or \n\nany Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity \n\nrequirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of \n\nsuch Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the \n\nLoans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have \n\nachieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such \n\nLender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such \n\nLender  \n\n \n46 \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\nsuch additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such \n\nreduction suffered.  \n\n \n(c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts \n\nnecessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) \n\nof this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such \n\nLender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.  \n\n \n(d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to \n\nthe foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such \n\ncompensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing \n\nprovisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the \n\ndate that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and \n\nof such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such \n\nincreased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include \n\nthe period of retroactive effect thereof).  \n\n \nSection 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative \n\nAgent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless \n\nfrom any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:  \n\n \n(a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of \n\nthe Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);  \n\n \n(b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to \n\nprepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or  \n\n \n(c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of \n\na request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;  \n\n \nexcluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment \n\nof funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds \n\nwere obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender \n\nin connection with the foregoing.  \n\n   \n\n47 \n\n  \n\n \nFor purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender \n\nshall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other \n\nborrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether \n\nor not such Loan was in fact so funded.  \n\n \nSection 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the \n\nBorrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental \n\nAuthority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is \n\nunable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender \n\nin accordance with Section 9.13.  \n\n \nSection 2.17.   Survival.   Each party’s obligations under Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 \n\nshall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Loan Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan \n\nDocuments, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.  \n\n \n\n\n\nArticle 3 \n\nRepresentations and Warranties  \n\n \nRepresentations and Warranties of the Borrower. In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent \n\nto enter into this Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make the Loans hereunder, the Borrower makes the following \n\nrepresentations and warranties as to itself and its Subsidiaries:  \n\n \nSection 3.01.   Existence and Power.   The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited \n\nliability company or limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its \n\njurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to do business in each additional jurisdiction necessary or advisable \n\nfor the conduct of its business, except for such failures to so qualify in such additional jurisdictions as would not, \n\nindividually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and each of \n\nits Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to own its Properties and to carry on its business as now being \n\nconducted and as proposed to be conducted. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational \n\npower to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants \n\nand the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower has all requisite organizational power to borrow \n\nthe Loans and issue the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Lenders and Warrantholders in accordance with \n\nthe terms hereof and thereof.  \n\n \n48 \n\n  \n    \n\nSection 3.02.    Authority.   The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower and each of its \n\nSubsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the \n\nBorrower’s issuance of the Notes to the Lenders and the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Warrantholders \n\nin accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, are within such Person’s organizational powers and have been duly \n\nauthorized by all necessary organizational action on the part of such Person’s board of directors (or comparable body) \n\nand, if necessary such Person’s shareholders, members or partners, as the case may be.  \n\n \nSection 3.03.    Binding Effect.   Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan \n\nDocuments has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto and each \n\nof the Notes and Warrants issued has been validly issued in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. Each of this \n\nAgreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the \n\nBorrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto enforceable against such Person in accordance with its respective \n\nterms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, \n\nor other laws relative to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally in effect from time to time and by \n\ngeneral principles of equity whether applied in equity or at law.  \n\n \nSection 3.04.    Capital Stock; Subsidiaries.   (a) As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the \n\nTransactions, the authorized and issued shares of each class of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its \n\nSubsidiaries will be as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a). As of the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, \n\nall of the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be validly \n\nissued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to any pre-emptive rights and owned of record and beneficially \n\nby the Persons listed on Schedule 3.04(a) free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.  \n\n \n(b)          As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, except as set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.04(a), neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of Capital Stock of, or have any \n\ndirect or indirect equity interest in, any other Person.  \n\n \n(c)           Except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(c), as of the Closing Date and after giving effect to the \n\nTransactions, there are no securities outstanding that are convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of Capital \n\nStock of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, nor are there outstanding any rights to subscribe for or purchase, or \n\nany options or warrants for the purchase of, or any agreements (contingent or otherwise) providing for the issuance \n\nof, or any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to, any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower  \n\n\n\n    \n\n49 \n\n  \n    \n\nor any of its Subsidiaries or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares.  \n\n \n(d)          On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of the Borrower or any of its \n\nSubsidiaries shall be subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase, acquire or retire (i) any of its \n\nCapital Stock, (ii) any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any of its Capital Stock, or (iii) any options, \n\nwarrants or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire any of its Capital Stock.  \n\n \nSection 3.05.   Business Operations and Other Information;   Financial Condition; No Material Adverse \n\nEffect. (a) The Borrower has heretofore delivered or caused to be delivered to each Lender copies of the Audited \n\nFinancial Statements (the “Financial Statements”). The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with \n\nGAAP (except as otherwise noted therein), consistently applied, and subject, in the case of each of the Financial \n\nStatements that are unaudited, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes, and \n\npresent fairly in all material respects the Consolidated financial position and related Consolidated income, \n\nstockholders’ equity and cash flows (as applicable) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at each of the dates and for \n\neach of the periods respectively covered thereby.  \n\n \n(b)          As of December 31, 2013, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries had any Indebtedness or \n\nliability, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or any Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities, \n\nliabilities for material taxes, long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, except as reflected or \n\nreserved against on the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements or described in the notes thereto.  \n\n \n(c)          Attached as Schedule 3.05(c) is a copy of the latest (as of the Closing Date) projections of the \n\nconsolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flow of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (assuming \n\nconsummation of the Transactions) for each of the fiscal years of the Borrower in the period from the Closing Date \n\nthrough 2015, including a detailed cash flow forecast for the 12-month period following the Closing Date. Such \n\nprojections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light \n\nof current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future \n\nfinancial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being \n\nacknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may \n\ncause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.  \n\n \n50 \n\n  \n    \n\n(d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of \n\nthe Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of \n\nthe historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been \n\ncompleted immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then \n\nended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial \n\nposition and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of \n\nbusiness on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date \n\nor at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to \n\nfairly reflect such assumptions.  \n\n \n(e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or \n\nwhich could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event \n\nwhich individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a \n\nDefault or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  \n\n \n\n\n\nSection 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.    (a) Except as set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.06, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened \n\nagainst or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties or rights which, if \n\nadversely determined, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse \n\nEffect.  \n\n \n(b)          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened \n\nagainst the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which seek to enjoin, or otherwise prevent the consummation of, the \n\ntransactions contemplated herein or to recover any damages or obtain any relief as a result of any of the transactions \n\ncontemplated herein in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority.  \n\n \n(c)          Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will be after giving effect to the \n\nconsummation of the Transactions, as the case may be, in default under or in violation of any Statute or Order, which \n\ndefault or violation, individually or in the aggregate together with all other such defaults and violations has had, or \n\ncould reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \nSection 3.07.   No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and \n\nits Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, \n\nissuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or  \n\n \n51 \n\n  \n\n \ncompliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the \n\nconsummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or \n\nprovisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to \n\nthe Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the \n\nOrganizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.  \n\n \nSection 3.08.   Consents, Etc.   No consent, approval or authorization of or declaration, registration or filing \n\nwith any Governmental Authority or any nongovernmental Person is required in connection with the execution or \n\ndelivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan \n\nDocuments or the performance by any such Person of its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or as a condition to the \n\nlegality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents, or \n\nthe consummation of any component of the Transactions, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, \n\ndeclarations, registrations or filings as are listed on Schedule 3.08, all of which have been or will on or prior to the \n\nClosing Date be obtained or made and are or will then be in full force and effect, and except those which the failure \n\nto obtain or make could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse \n\nEffect.  \n\n \nSection 3.09.    Outstanding Indebtedness.   Schedule 6.01(a) sets forth a correct and complete list and brief \n\ndescription of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness evidenced by the \n\nLoans) existing on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, in each case showing the aggregate \n\nprincipal amount thereof (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn commitments with respect thereto), the name of \n\nthe respective borrower and any other entity which directly or indirectly guarantees such debt and all Liens securing \n\nsuch Indebtedness.  \n\n \nSection 3.10.   Taxes.  The Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, has timely filed all U.S. federal \n\nand all material state, local and foreign tax returns, information returns and excise tax returns, forms and reports for \n\nTaxes (“Tax Returns”) with the appropriate Governmental Authority which were or are required to have been filed \n\nby or on behalf of any such Persons and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and accurately reflect in \n\n\n\nall material respects all liability for Taxes of the Borrower or Subsidiary taken as a whole for the periods covered \n\nthereby. All Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other material Taxes and assessments payable \n\nby the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof have been timely paid to the appropriate Governmental  \n\n    \n\n52 \n\n  \n    \n\nAuthority, unless such Tax liability is being diligently contested in good faith and the Borrower and/or the appropriate \n\nSubsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, has adequately reserved against such Tax liability on its books and financial \n\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted \n\nwith respect to any such Taxes as of the date hereof. No material Tax assessment against the Borrower, or any \n\nSubsidiary thereof has been proposed, formally or informally. The Tax liabilities of the Borrower and any Subsidiary \n\nthereof are adequately provided for on the relevant Person’s books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP.  \n\n \nSection 3.11.   Disclosure.   None of this Agreement nor any other document or certificate furnished to any \n\nLender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith (including the Financial \n\nStatements), taken in the aggregate, contained, as of its respective date and as of the Closing Date, and no document \n\nor certificate which shall be furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in \n\nconnection herewith, when taken as a whole with, all documents and certificates previously delivered, shall contain, \n\nas of its date of delivery, any untrue statement of a material fact, or as of any such date omitted to state a material fact \n\nnecessary in order to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they \n\nwere made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents \n\nonly that such information was prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it \n\nbeing acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which \n\nmay cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary from the projected results. Neither the \n\nBorrower nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any facts (other than matters of a general economic or political nature) \n\nthat individually or in the aggregate have had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \nSection 3.12.    Margin Regulations.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or intends to \n\nacquire any “margin stock” as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of \n\nthe United States (12 CFR 207). No part of the proceeds of the Loans or the Warrants will be used, and no part of the \n\nproceeds of any loans repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the Loans or the Warrants was used, directly or \n\nindirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board \n\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or \n\ncarrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in \n\na violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation \n\nT of said Board (12 CFR 220). Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries or any agent acting on its behalf has \n\ntaken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or the Loans to violate  \n\n \n53 \n\n  \n\n \nRegulation U, Regulation X, Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n\nSystem of the United States or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter \n\nbe in effect. As used in this Section 3.12, the term “purpose of buying or carrying” has the meaning assigned thereto \n\nin the aforesaid Regulation U.  \n\n \nSection 3.13.   Pension and Benefit Plans.   (a) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material \n\nAdverse Effect, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, each of the Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates is in \n\ncompliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published interpretations \n\nthereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other \n\nsuch ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no Unfunded \n\nPension Liability with respect to any Plans that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \n\n\n\n(b)          Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign \n\nPension Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all requirements of law applicable thereto and the respective \n\nrequirements of the governing documents for such plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material \n\nAdverse Effect, With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, none of the Borrower, any Subsidiaries or any of their \n\nrespective directors, officers, employees or agents has engaged in a transaction which would subject the Borrower or \n\nany Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to a tax or civil penalty. With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, reserves \n\nhave been established in the financial statements furnished to Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities in \n\naccordance with applicable law and prudent business practice or, where required, in accordance with ordinary \n\naccounting practices in the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Pension Plan is maintained. The aggregate unfunded \n\nliabilities with respect to Foreign Pension Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect \n\nassuming proper funding and administration of such foreign Pension Plans on an ongoing basis.  \n\n \nSection 3.14.     Labor Matters.

If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be \n\nrequired by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case \n\nmay be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender  \n\n    \n\n39 \n\n  \n    \n\nor the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party \n\nshall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made \n\nall required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable \n\nunder this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the \n\nsum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all \n\nsuch deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant \n\nGovernmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  \n\n \n(b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or \n\nfuture stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or \n\nfrom the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a \n\nsecurity interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).  \n\n \n(c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them \n\nharmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent \n\n(as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such \n\nIndemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This \n\nindemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may \n\nbe) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the \n\nBorrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or \n\non behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  \n\n \nEach Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for \n\n(i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already \n\nindemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure \n\nto comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) \n\nany Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in \n\nconnection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not \n\nsuch Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from \n\nthe Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent \n\nmanifest error.  \n\n    \n\n40 \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n(d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the \n\nAdministrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such \n\nother evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.  \n\n \n(e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding \n\nTax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative \n\nAgent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly \n\ncompleted and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will \n\npermit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if \n\nreasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed \n\nby applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower \n\nor the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information \n\nreporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, \n\nexecution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), \n\n(ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or \n\nsubmission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice \n\nthe legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender \n\nthat is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such \n\nLender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the \n\nBorrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt \n\nfrom U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, \n\ndeliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) \n\non or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is \n\napplicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States \n\nis a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-\n\n8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the \n\n“interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, \n\nIRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\npursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)  \n\n    \n\n41 \n\n  \n\n \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption \n\nfor portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the \n\neffect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent \n\nshareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign \n\ncorporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed \n\noriginals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a \n\nU.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other \n\ncertification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership \n\nand one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such \n\nForeign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of \n\neach such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver \n\nto the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or \n\nprior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other \n\nform prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding \n\nTax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to \n\npermit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and \n\n(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\n\n\nimposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA \n\n(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the \n\nBorrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably \n\nrequested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including \n\nas prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by \n\nthe Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to \n\ncomply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s \n\nobligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes \n\nof this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each \n\nLender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any \n\nrespect, it shall update  \n\n    \n\n42 \n\n  \n    \n\nsuch form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability \n\nto do so.  \n\n \nSection 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to \n\nany Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender \n\nshall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to \n\nassign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such \n\nLender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the \n\nfuture, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be \n\ndisadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in \n\nconnection with any such designation or assignment.  \n\n \nSection 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether \n\nvoluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it \n\n(other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the \n\nLoans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in \n\nthe Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably \n\nwith each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such \n\npurchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing \n\nLender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share \n\n(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered \n\nfrom the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of \n\nthe total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender \n\npursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including \n\nthe right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower \n\nor a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.  \n\n \nSection 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an \n\ninducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders \n\nits warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to \n\nadjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to \n\nbe substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, \n\nor delivered in substitution or exchange for  \n\n \n43 \n\n  \n    \n\nany thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to \n\nthe contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable \n\n(subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of \n\n\n\nthe Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each \n\ncase immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  \n\n \n(b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower \n\nwill issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each \n\nWarrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the \n\nClosing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder \n\na Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants \n\nto be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased \n\nby such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such \n\nWarrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such \n\nnotice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants \n\ndeliverable to such Warrantholder).  \n\n \n(c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-\n\n2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal \n\namount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue \n\nprice allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue \n\nprice and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated \n\nhereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent \n\njurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.  \n\n \nSection 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any \n\nGovernmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority \n\nof such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice \n\nthereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or \n\ncontinue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such  \n\n \n44 \n\n  \n\n \nLender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such \n\nLender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid \n\nsuch illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the \n\nBase Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain \n\nsuch LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such \n\nLIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates \n\nbased upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base \n\nRate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative \n\nAgent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the \n\namount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.  \n\n \nSection 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a \n\ncontinuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks \n\nin the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and \n\nreasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the \n\naffected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR \n\nRate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation \n\nof the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such \n\n\n\nnotice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).  \n\n \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in \n\nclause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with \n\nrespect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the \n\nImpacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected \n\nLenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and \n\nfairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has \n\nmade it unlawful, or that  \n\n \n45 \n\n  \n\n \nany Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine \n\nor charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the \n\nauthority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written \n\nnotice thereof.  \n\n \nSection 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change \n\nin Law shall:  \n\n \n(i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance \n\ncharge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or \n\nparticipated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;  \n\n \n(ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified \n\nTaxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection \n\nIncome Taxes); or  \n\n \n(iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense \n\naffecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or \n\nparticipation therein;  \n\n \nand the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing \n\nor maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case \n\nof clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such \n\nLender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, \n\ninterest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional \n\namount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  \n\n \n(b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or \n\nany Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity \n\nrequirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of \n\nsuch Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the \n\nLoans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have \n\nachieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such \n\nLender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such \n\nLender  \n\n \n46 \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\nsuch additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such \n\nreduction suffered.  \n\n \n(c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts \n\nnecessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) \n\nof this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such \n\nLender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.  \n\n \n(d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to \n\nthe foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such \n\ncompensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing \n\nprovisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the \n\ndate that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and \n\nof such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such \n\nincreased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include \n\nthe period of retroactive effect thereof).  \n\n \nSection 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative \n\nAgent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless \n\nfrom any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:  \n\n \n(a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of \n\nthe Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);  \n\n \n(b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to \n\nprepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or  \n\n \n(c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of \n\na request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;  \n\n \nexcluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment \n\nof funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds \n\nwere obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender \n\nin connection with the foregoing.  \n\n   \n\n47 \n\n  \n\n \nFor purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender \n\nshall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other \n\nborrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether \n\nor not such Loan was in fact so funded.  \n\n \nSection 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the \n\nBorrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental \n\nAuthority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is \n\nunable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender \n\nin accordance with Section 9.13.  \n\n \nSection 2.17.   Survival.   Each party’s obligations under Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 \n\nshall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Loan Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan \n\nDocuments, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.  \n\n \n\n\n\nArticle 3 \n\nRepresentations and Warranties  \n\n \nRepresentations and Warranties of the Borrower. In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent \n\nto enter into this Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make the Loans hereunder, the Borrower makes the following \n\nrepresentations and warranties as to itself and its Subsidiaries:  \n\n \nSection 3.01.   Existence and Power.   The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited \n\nliability company or limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its \n\njurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to do business in each additional jurisdiction necessary or advisable \n\nfor the conduct of its business, except for such failures to so qualify in such additional jurisdictions as would not, \n\nindividually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and each of \n\nits Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to own its Properties and to carry on its business as now being \n\nconducted and as proposed to be conducted. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational \n\npower to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants \n\nand the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower has all requisite organizational power to borrow \n\nthe Loans and issue the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Lenders and Warrantholders in accordance with \n\nthe terms hereof and thereof.  \n\n \n48 \n\n  \n    \n\nSection 3.02.

Each of this \n\nAgreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the \n\nBorrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto enforceable against such Person in accordance with its respective \n\nterms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, \n\nor other laws relative to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally in effect from time to time and by \n\ngeneral principles of equity whether applied in equity or at law.  \n\n \nSection 3.04.

As of the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, \n\nall of the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be validly \n\nissued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to any pre-emptive rights and owned of record and beneficially \n\nby the Persons listed on Schedule 3.04(a) free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.  \n\n \n(b)          As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, except as set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.04(a), neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of Capital Stock of, or have any \n\ndirect or indirect equity interest in, any other Person.  \n\n \n(c)           Except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(c), as of the Closing Date and after giving effect to the \n\nTransactions, there are no securities outstanding that are convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of Capital \n\nStock of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, nor are there outstanding any rights to subscribe for or purchase, or \n\nany options or warrants for the purchase of, or any agreements (contingent or otherwise) providing for the issuance \n\nof, or any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to, any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower  \n\n\n\n    \n\n49 \n\n  \n    \n\nor any of its Subsidiaries or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares.  \n\n \n(d)          On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of the Borrower or any of its \n\nSubsidiaries shall be subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase, acquire or retire (i) any of its \n\nCapital Stock, (ii) any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any of its Capital Stock, or (iii) any options, \n\nwarrants or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire any of its Capital Stock.  \n\n \nSection 3.05.   Business Operations and Other Information;   Financial Condition; No Material Adverse \n\nEffect. (a) The Borrower has heretofore delivered or caused to be delivered to each Lender copies of the Audited \n\nFinancial Statements (the “Financial Statements”). The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with \n\nGAAP (except as otherwise noted therein), consistently applied, and subject, in the case of each of the Financial \n\nStatements that are unaudited, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes, and \n\npresent fairly in all material respects the Consolidated financial position and related Consolidated income, \n\nstockholders’ equity and cash flows (as applicable) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at each of the dates and for \n\neach of the periods respectively covered thereby.  \n\n \n(b)          As of December 31, 2013, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries had any Indebtedness or \n\nliability, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or any Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities, \n\nliabilities for material taxes, long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, except as reflected or \n\nreserved against on the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements or described in the notes thereto.  \n\n \n(c)          Attached as Schedule 3.05(c) is a copy of the latest (as of the Closing Date) projections of the \n\nconsolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flow of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (assuming \n\nconsummation of the Transactions) for each of the fiscal years of the Borrower in the period from the Closing Date \n\nthrough 2015, including a detailed cash flow forecast for the 12-month period following the Closing Date. Such \n\nprojections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light \n\nof current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future \n\nfinancial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being \n\nacknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may \n\ncause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.  \n\n \n50 \n\n  \n    \n\n(d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of \n\nthe Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of \n\nthe historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been \n\ncompleted immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then \n\nended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial \n\nposition and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of \n\nbusiness on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date \n\nor at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to \n\nfairly reflect such assumptions.  \n\n \n(e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or \n\nwhich could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event \n\nwhich individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a \n\nDefault or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  \n\n \n\n\n\nSection 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.    (a) Except as set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.06, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened \n\nagainst or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties or rights which, if \n\nadversely determined, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse \n\nEffect.  \n\n \n(b)          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened \n\nagainst the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which seek to enjoin, or otherwise prevent the consummation of, the \n\ntransactions contemplated herein or to recover any damages or obtain any relief as a result of any of the transactions \n\ncontemplated herein in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority.  \n\n \n(c)          Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will be after giving effect to the \n\nconsummation of the Transactions, as the case may be, in default under or in violation of any Statute or Order, which \n\ndefault or violation, individually or in the aggregate together with all other such defaults and violations has had, or \n\ncould reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \nSection 3.07.   No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and \n\nits Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, \n\nissuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or  \n\n \n51 \n\n  \n\n \ncompliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the \n\nconsummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or \n\nprovisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to \n\nthe Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the \n\nOrganizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.  \n\n \nSection 3.08.   Consents, Etc.   No consent, approval or authorization of or declaration, registration or filing \n\nwith any Governmental Authority or any nongovernmental Person is required in connection with the execution or \n\ndelivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan \n\nDocuments or the performance by any such Person of its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or as a condition to the \n\nlegality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents, or \n\nthe consummation of any component of the Transactions, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, \n\ndeclarations, registrations or filings as are listed on Schedule 3.08, all of which have been or will on or prior to the \n\nClosing Date be obtained or made and are or will then be in full force and effect, and except those which the failure \n\nto obtain or make could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse \n\nEffect.  \n\n \nSection 3.09.    Outstanding Indebtedness.   Schedule 6.01(a) sets forth a correct and complete list and brief \n\ndescription of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness evidenced by the \n\nLoans) existing on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, in each case showing the aggregate \n\nprincipal amount thereof (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn commitments with respect thereto), the name of \n\nthe respective borrower and any other entity which directly or indirectly guarantees such debt and all Liens securing \n\nsuch Indebtedness.  \n\n \nSection 3.10.   Taxes.  The Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, has timely filed all U.S. federal \n\nand all material state, local and foreign tax returns, information returns and excise tax returns, forms and reports for \n\nTaxes (“Tax Returns”) with the appropriate Governmental Authority which were or are required to have been filed \n\nby or on behalf of any such Persons and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and accurately reflect in \n\n\n\nall material respects all liability for Taxes of the Borrower or Subsidiary taken as a whole for the periods covered \n\nthereby. All Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other material Taxes and assessments payable \n\nby the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof have been timely paid to the appropriate Governmental  \n\n    \n\n52 \n\n  \n    \n\nAuthority, unless such Tax liability is being diligently contested in good faith and the Borrower and/or the appropriate \n\nSubsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, has adequately reserved against such Tax liability on its books and financial \n\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted \n\nwith respect to any such Taxes as of the date hereof. No material Tax assessment against the Borrower, or any \n\nSubsidiary thereof has been proposed, formally or informally. The Tax liabilities of the Borrower and any Subsidiary \n\nthereof are adequately provided for on the relevant Person’s books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP.  \n\n \nSection 3.11.   Disclosure.   None of this Agreement nor any other document or certificate furnished to any \n\nLender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith (including the Financial \n\nStatements), taken in the aggregate, contained, as of its respective date and as of the Closing Date, and no document \n\nor certificate which shall be furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in \n\nconnection herewith, when taken as a whole with, all documents and certificates previously delivered, shall contain, \n\nas of its date of delivery, any untrue statement of a material fact, or as of any such date omitted to state a material fact \n\nnecessary in order to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they \n\nwere made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents \n\nonly that such information was prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it \n\nbeing acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which \n\nmay cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary from the projected results. Neither the \n\nBorrower nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any facts (other than matters of a general economic or political nature) \n\nthat individually or in the aggregate have had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \nSection 3.12.    Margin Regulations.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or intends to \n\nacquire any “margin stock” as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of \n\nthe United States (12 CFR 207). No part of the proceeds of the Loans or the Warrants will be used, and no part of the \n\nproceeds of any loans repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the Loans or the Warrants was used, directly or \n\nindirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board \n\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or \n\ncarrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in \n\na violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation \n\nT of said Board (12 CFR 220). Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries or any agent acting on its behalf has \n\ntaken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or the Loans to violate  \n\n \n53 \n\n  \n\n \nRegulation U, Regulation X, Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n\nSystem of the United States or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter \n\nbe in effect. As used in this Section 3.12, the term “purpose of buying or carrying” has the meaning assigned thereto \n\nin the aforesaid Regulation U.  \n\n \nSection 3.13.   Pension and Benefit Plans.   (a) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material \n\nAdverse Effect, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, each of the Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates is in \n\ncompliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published interpretations \n\nthereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other \n\nsuch ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no Unfunded \n\nPension Liability with respect to any Plans that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \n\n\n\n(b)          Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign \n\nPension Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all requirements of law applicable thereto and the respective \n\nrequirements of the governing documents for such plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material \n\nAdverse Effect, With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, none of the Borrower, any Subsidiaries or any of their \n\nrespective directors, officers, employees or agents has engaged in a transaction which would subject the Borrower or \n\nany Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to a tax or civil penalty. With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, reserves \n\nhave been established in the financial statements furnished to Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities in \n\naccordance with applicable law and prudent business practice or, where required, in accordance with ordinary \n\naccounting practices in the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Pension Plan is maintained. The aggregate unfunded \n\nliabilities with respect to Foreign Pension Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect \n\nassuming proper funding and administration of such foreign Pension Plans on an ongoing basis.  \n\n \nSection 3.14.     Labor Matters.   As of the date hereof and the Closing Date, there are no strikes, lockouts or \n\nslowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge the Borrower, threatened. The hours \n\nworked by and payments made to employees of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the \n\nFair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters. All \n\npayments due from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any \n\nSubsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or \n\naccrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions will \n\nnot give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation  \n\n    \n\n54 \n\n  \n\n \non the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.  \n\n \nSection 3.15.

Ranking of Loans.   The Indebtedness represented by the Loans and the other Loan Obligations \n\nunder the applicable Loan Documents of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties is intended to constitute senior \n\nIndebtedness, and accordingly is, and shall be, at all times while the Loans and the other Loan Obligations remain \n\noutstanding senior in right of payment to, or pari passu with, all Indebtedness of the Loan Parties.  \n\n \nSection 3.21.   Solvency.   The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are Solvent on the Closing \n\nDate both before and after giving effect to the Transactions to be effected on the Closing Date and the application of \n\nthe net proceeds of the Loans and the Warrants.  \n\n \nSection 3.22.

Each determination by the Administrative Agent \n\nof an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  \n\n \n(c)         Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a \n\nBusiness Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in \n\nsuch case be included in the computation of payment of interest.  \n\n    \n\n38 \n\n  \n    \n\n(d)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on \n\nwhich any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the \n\nAdministrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on \n\nsuch date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such \n\nLender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower \n\nshall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the \n\nAdministrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for \n\neach day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to \n\nthe Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.  \n\n \n(e)         The Loan Parties’ obligation to pay all amounts due hereunder and under any other Loan Documents \n\nshall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including:  \n\n \n(i)         any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, deduction, abatement, suspension, diminution, \n\nreduction, defense or other right which any Loan Party may have against any supplier, whether such supplier \n\nwas paid from the proceeds of Loans or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever arising under or pursuant to \n\nany supply agreement or otherwise relating to the purchase of goods, other property or services from or by \n\nany such supplier;  \n\n\n\n \n(ii)         any defect in the condition, design, operation, or fitness for use of, or any damage to \n\nor loss or destruction of, any equipment or material provided by any such supplier;  \n\n \n(iii)         any actual or alleged default by any such supplier or any other Person under any \n\nsupply agreement; or  \n\n \n(iv)         any other fact or circumstance relating to any supply agreement.  \n\n \nSection 2.08. Taxes. (a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any \n\nobligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or \n\nwithholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings \n\nor other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, \n\nadditions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be \n\nrequired by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case \n\nmay be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender  \n\n    \n\n39 \n\n  \n    \n\nor the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party \n\nshall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made \n\nall required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable \n\nunder this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the \n\nsum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all \n\nsuch deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant \n\nGovernmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  \n\n \n(b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or \n\nfuture stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or \n\nfrom the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a \n\nsecurity interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).  \n\n \n(c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them \n\nharmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent \n\n(as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such \n\nIndemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This \n\nindemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may \n\nbe) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the \n\nBorrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or \n\non behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  \n\n \nEach Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for \n\n(i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already \n\nindemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure \n\nto comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) \n\nany Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in \n\nconnection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not \n\nsuch Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from \n\nthe Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent \n\nmanifest error.  \n\n    \n\n40 \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n(d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the \n\nAdministrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such \n\nother evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.  \n\n \n(e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding \n\nTax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative \n\nAgent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly \n\ncompleted and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will \n\npermit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if \n\nreasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed \n\nby applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower \n\nor the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information \n\nreporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, \n\nexecution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), \n\n(ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or \n\nsubmission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice \n\nthe legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender \n\nthat is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such \n\nLender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the \n\nBorrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt \n\nfrom U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, \n\ndeliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) \n\non or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is \n\napplicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States \n\nis a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-\n\n8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the \n\n“interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, \n\nIRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\npursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)  \n\n    \n\n41 \n\n  \n\n \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption \n\nfor portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the \n\neffect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent \n\nshareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign \n\ncorporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed \n\noriginals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a \n\nU.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other \n\ncertification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership \n\nand one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such \n\nForeign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of \n\neach such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver \n\nto the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or \n\nprior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other \n\nform prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding \n\nTax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to \n\npermit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and \n\n(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\n\n\nimposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA \n\n(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the \n\nBorrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably \n\nrequested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including \n\nas prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by \n\nthe Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to \n\ncomply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s \n\nobligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes \n\nof this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each \n\nLender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any \n\nrespect, it shall update  \n\n    \n\n42 \n\n  \n    \n\nsuch form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability \n\nto do so.  \n\n \nSection 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to \n\nany Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender \n\nshall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to \n\nassign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such \n\nLender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the \n\nfuture, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be \n\ndisadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in \n\nconnection with any such designation or assignment.  \n\n \nSection 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether \n\nvoluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it \n\n(other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the \n\nLoans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in \n\nthe Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably \n\nwith each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such \n\npurchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing \n\nLender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share \n\n(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered \n\nfrom the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of \n\nthe total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender \n\npursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including \n\nthe right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower \n\nor a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.  \n\n \nSection 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an \n\ninducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders \n\nits warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to \n\nadjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to \n\nbe substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, \n\nor delivered in substitution or exchange for  \n\n \n43 \n\n  \n    \n\nany thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to \n\nthe contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable \n\n(subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of \n\n\n\nthe Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each \n\ncase immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  \n\n \n(b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower \n\nwill issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each \n\nWarrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the \n\nClosing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder \n\na Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants \n\nto be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased \n\nby such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such \n\nWarrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such \n\nnotice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants \n\ndeliverable to such Warrantholder).  \n\n \n(c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-\n\n2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal \n\namount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue \n\nprice allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue \n\nprice and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated \n\nhereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent \n\njurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.  \n\n \nSection 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any \n\nGovernmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority \n\nof such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice \n\nthereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or \n\ncontinue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such  \n\n \n44 \n\n  \n\n \nLender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such \n\nLender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid \n\nsuch illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the \n\nBase Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain \n\nsuch LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such \n\nLIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates \n\nbased upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base \n\nRate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative \n\nAgent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the \n\namount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.  \n\n \nSection 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a \n\ncontinuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks \n\nin the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and \n\nreasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the \n\naffected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR \n\nRate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation \n\nof the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such \n\n\n\nnotice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).  \n\n \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in \n\nclause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with \n\nrespect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the \n\nImpacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected \n\nLenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and \n\nfairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has \n\nmade it unlawful, or that  \n\n \n45 \n\n  \n\n \nany Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine \n\nor charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the \n\nauthority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written \n\nnotice thereof.  \n\n \nSection 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change \n\nin Law shall:  \n\n \n(i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance \n\ncharge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or \n\nparticipated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;  \n\n \n(ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified \n\nTaxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection \n\nIncome Taxes); or  \n\n \n(iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense \n\naffecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or \n\nparticipation therein;  \n\n \nand the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing \n\nor maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case \n\nof clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such \n\nLender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, \n\ninterest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional \n\namount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  \n\n \n(b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or \n\nany Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity \n\nrequirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of \n\nsuch Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the \n\nLoans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have \n\nachieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such \n\nLender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such \n\nLender  \n\n \n46 \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\nsuch additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such \n\nreduction suffered.  \n\n \n(c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts \n\nnecessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) \n\nof this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such \n\nLender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.  \n\n \n(d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to \n\nthe foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such \n\ncompensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing \n\nprovisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the \n\ndate that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and \n\nof such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such \n\nincreased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include \n\nthe period of retroactive effect thereof).  \n\n \nSection 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative \n\nAgent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless \n\nfrom any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:  \n\n \n(a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of \n\nthe Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);  \n\n \n(b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to \n\nprepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or  \n\n \n(c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of \n\na request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;  \n\n \nexcluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment \n\nof funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds \n\nwere obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender \n\nin connection with the foregoing.  \n\n   \n\n47 \n\n  \n\n \nFor purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender \n\nshall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other \n\nborrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether \n\nor not such Loan was in fact so funded.  \n\n \nSection 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the \n\nBorrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental \n\nAuthority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is \n\nunable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender \n\nin accordance with Section 9.13.  \n\n \nSection 2.17.   Survival.   Each party’s obligations under Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 \n\nshall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Loan Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan \n\nDocuments, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.  \n\n \n\n\n\nArticle 3 \n\nRepresentations and Warranties  \n\n \nRepresentations and Warranties of the Borrower. In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent \n\nto enter into this Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make the Loans hereunder, the Borrower makes the following \n\nrepresentations and warranties as to itself and its Subsidiaries:  \n\n \nSection 3.01.   Existence and Power.

Business Operations and Other Information;   Financial Condition; No Material Adverse \n\nEffect. (a) The Borrower has heretofore delivered or caused to be delivered to each Lender copies of the Audited \n\nFinancial Statements (the “Financial Statements”). The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with \n\nGAAP (except as otherwise noted therein), consistently applied, and subject, in the case of each of the Financial \n\nStatements that are unaudited, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes, and \n\npresent fairly in all material respects the Consolidated financial position and related Consolidated income, \n\nstockholders’ equity and cash flows (as applicable) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at each of the dates and for \n\neach of the periods respectively covered thereby.  \n\n \n(b)          As of December 31, 2013, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries had any Indebtedness or \n\nliability, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or any Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities, \n\nliabilities for material taxes, long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, except as reflected or \n\nreserved against on the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements or described in the notes thereto.  \n\n \n(c)          Attached as Schedule 3.05(c) is a copy of the latest (as of the Closing Date) projections of the \n\nconsolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flow of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (assuming \n\nconsummation of the Transactions) for each of the fiscal years of the Borrower in the period from the Closing Date \n\nthrough 2015, including a detailed cash flow forecast for the 12-month period following the Closing Date. Such \n\nprojections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light \n\nof current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future \n\nfinancial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being \n\nacknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may \n\ncause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.  \n\n \n50 \n\n  \n    \n\n(d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of \n\nthe Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of \n\nthe historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been \n\ncompleted immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then \n\nended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial \n\nposition and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of \n\nbusiness on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date \n\nor at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to \n\nfairly reflect such assumptions.  \n\n \n(e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or \n\nwhich could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event \n\nwhich individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a \n\nDefault or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  \n\n \n\n\n\nSection 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.    (a) Except as set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.06, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened \n\nagainst or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties or rights which, if \n\nadversely determined, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse \n\nEffect.  \n\n \n(b)          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened \n\nagainst the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which seek to enjoin, or otherwise prevent the consummation of, the \n\ntransactions contemplated herein or to recover any damages or obtain any relief as a result of any of the transactions \n\ncontemplated herein in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority.  \n\n \n(c)          Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will be after giving effect to the \n\nconsummation of the Transactions, as the case may be, in default under or in violation of any Statute or Order, which \n\ndefault or violation, individually or in the aggregate together with all other such defaults and violations has had, or \n\ncould reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \nSection 3.07.   No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and \n\nits Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, \n\nissuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or  \n\n \n51 \n\n  \n\n \ncompliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the \n\nconsummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or \n\nprovisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to \n\nthe Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the \n\nOrganizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.  \n\n \nSection 3.08.   Consents, Etc.   No consent, approval or authorization of or declaration, registration or filing \n\nwith any Governmental Authority or any nongovernmental Person is required in connection with the execution or \n\ndelivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan \n\nDocuments or the performance by any such Person of its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or as a condition to the \n\nlegality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents, or \n\nthe consummation of any component of the Transactions, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, \n\ndeclarations, registrations or filings as are listed on Schedule 3.08, all of which have been or will on or prior to the \n\nClosing Date be obtained or made and are or will then be in full force and effect, and except those which the failure \n\nto obtain or make could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse \n\nEffect.  \n\n \nSection 3.09.    Outstanding Indebtedness.   Schedule 6.01(a) sets forth a correct and complete list and brief \n\ndescription of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness evidenced by the \n\nLoans) existing on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, in each case showing the aggregate \n\nprincipal amount thereof (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn commitments with respect thereto), the name of \n\nthe respective borrower and any other entity which directly or indirectly guarantees such debt and all Liens securing \n\nsuch Indebtedness.  \n\n \nSection 3.10.   Taxes.  The Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, has timely filed all U.S. federal \n\nand all material state, local and foreign tax returns, information returns and excise tax returns, forms and reports for \n\nTaxes (“Tax Returns”) with the appropriate Governmental Authority which were or are required to have been filed \n\nby or on behalf of any such Persons and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and accurately reflect in \n\n\n\nall material respects all liability for Taxes of the Borrower or Subsidiary taken as a whole for the periods covered \n\nthereby. All Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other material Taxes and assessments payable \n\nby the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof have been timely paid to the appropriate Governmental  \n\n    \n\n52 \n\n  \n    \n\nAuthority, unless such Tax liability is being diligently contested in good faith and the Borrower and/or the appropriate \n\nSubsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, has adequately reserved against such Tax liability on its books and financial \n\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted \n\nwith respect to any such Taxes as of the date hereof. No material Tax assessment against the Borrower, or any \n\nSubsidiary thereof has been proposed, formally or informally. The Tax liabilities of the Borrower and any Subsidiary \n\nthereof are adequately provided for on the relevant Person’s books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP.  \n\n \nSection 3.11.   Disclosure.   None of this Agreement nor any other document or certificate furnished to any \n\nLender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith (including the Financial \n\nStatements), taken in the aggregate, contained, as of its respective date and as of the Closing Date, and no document \n\nor certificate which shall be furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in \n\nconnection herewith, when taken as a whole with, all documents and certificates previously delivered, shall contain, \n\nas of its date of delivery, any untrue statement of a material fact, or as of any such date omitted to state a material fact \n\nnecessary in order to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they \n\nwere made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents \n\nonly that such information was prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it \n\nbeing acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which \n\nmay cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary from the projected results. Neither the \n\nBorrower nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any facts (other than matters of a general economic or political nature) \n\nthat individually or in the aggregate have had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \nSection 3.12.    Margin Regulations.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or intends to \n\nacquire any “margin stock” as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of \n\nthe United States (12 CFR 207). No part of the proceeds of the Loans or the Warrants will be used, and no part of the \n\nproceeds of any loans repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the Loans or the Warrants was used, directly or \n\nindirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board \n\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or \n\ncarrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in \n\na violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation \n\nT of said Board (12 CFR 220). Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries or any agent acting on its behalf has \n\ntaken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or the Loans to violate  \n\n \n53 \n\n  \n\n \nRegulation U, Regulation X, Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n\nSystem of the United States or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter \n\nbe in effect. As used in this Section 3.12, the term “purpose of buying or carrying” has the meaning assigned thereto \n\nin the aforesaid Regulation U.  \n\n \nSection 3.13.   Pension and Benefit Plans.   (a) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material \n\nAdverse Effect, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, each of the Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates is in \n\ncompliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published interpretations \n\nthereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other \n\nsuch ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no Unfunded \n\nPension Liability with respect to any Plans that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \n\n\n\n(b)          Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign \n\nPension Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all requirements of law applicable thereto and the respective \n\nrequirements of the governing documents for such plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material \n\nAdverse Effect, With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, none of the Borrower, any Subsidiaries or any of their \n\nrespective directors, officers, employees or agents has engaged in a transaction which would subject the Borrower or \n\nany Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to a tax or civil penalty.

The aggregate unfunded \n\nliabilities with respect to Foreign Pension Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect \n\nassuming proper funding and administration of such foreign Pension Plans on an ongoing basis.  \n\n \nSection 3.14.     Labor Matters.   As of the date hereof and the Closing Date, there are no strikes, lockouts or \n\nslowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge the Borrower, threatened.

Ranking of Loans.   The Indebtedness represented by the Loans and the other Loan Obligations \n\nunder the applicable Loan Documents of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties is intended to constitute senior \n\nIndebtedness, and accordingly is, and shall be, at all times while the Loans and the other Loan Obligations remain \n\noutstanding senior in right of payment to, or pari passu with, all Indebtedness of the Loan Parties.  \n\n \nSection 3.21.   Solvency.   The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are Solvent on the Closing \n\nDate both before and after giving effect to the Transactions to be effected on the Closing Date and the application of \n\nthe net proceeds of the Loans and the Warrants.  \n\n \nSection 3.22.

If and to the extent the Borrower \n\nshall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the \n\nAdministrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for \n\neach day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to \n\nthe Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.  \n\n \n(e)         The Loan Parties’ obligation to pay all amounts due hereunder and under any other Loan Documents \n\nshall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including:  \n\n \n(i)         any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, deduction, abatement, suspension, diminution, \n\nreduction, defense or other right which any Loan Party may have against any supplier, whether such supplier \n\nwas paid from the proceeds of Loans or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever arising under or pursuant to \n\nany supply agreement or otherwise relating to the purchase of goods, other property or services from or by \n\nany such supplier;  \n\n\n\n \n(ii)         any defect in the condition, design, operation, or fitness for use of, or any damage to \n\nor loss or destruction of, any equipment or material provided by any such supplier;  \n\n \n(iii)         any actual or alleged default by any such supplier or any other Person under any \n\nsupply agreement; or  \n\n \n(iv)         any other fact or circumstance relating to any supply agreement.  \n\n \nSection 2.08.

(a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any \n\nobligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or \n\nwithholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings \n\nor other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, \n\nadditions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be \n\nrequired by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case \n\nmay be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender  \n\n    \n\n39 \n\n  \n    \n\nor the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party \n\nshall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made \n\nall required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable \n\nunder this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the \n\nsum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all \n\nsuch deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant \n\nGovernmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  \n\n \n(b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or \n\nfuture stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or \n\nfrom the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a \n\nsecurity interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).  \n\n \n(c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them \n\nharmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent \n\n(as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such \n\nIndemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This \n\nindemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may \n\nbe) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the \n\nBorrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or \n\non behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  \n\n \nEach Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for \n\n(i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already \n\nindemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure \n\nto comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) \n\nany Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in \n\nconnection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not \n\nsuch Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from \n\nthe Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent \n\nmanifest error.  \n\n    \n\n40 \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n(d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the \n\nAdministrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such \n\nother evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.  \n\n \n(e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding \n\nTax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative \n\nAgent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly \n\ncompleted and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will \n\npermit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if \n\nreasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed \n\nby applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower \n\nor the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information \n\nreporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, \n\nexecution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), \n\n(ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or \n\nsubmission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice \n\nthe legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender \n\nthat is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such \n\nLender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the \n\nBorrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt \n\nfrom U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, \n\ndeliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) \n\non or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is \n\napplicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States \n\nis a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-\n\n8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the \n\n“interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, \n\nIRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\npursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)  \n\n    \n\n41 \n\n  \n\n \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption \n\nfor portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the \n\neffect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent \n\nshareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign \n\ncorporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed \n\noriginals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a \n\nU.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other \n\ncertification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership \n\nand one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such \n\nForeign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of \n\neach such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver \n\nto the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or \n\nprior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other \n\nform prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding \n\nTax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to \n\npermit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and \n\n(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\n\n\nimposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA \n\n(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the \n\nBorrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably \n\nrequested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including \n\nas prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by \n\nthe Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to \n\ncomply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s \n\nobligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes \n\nof this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each \n\nLender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any \n\nrespect, it shall update  \n\n    \n\n42 \n\n  \n    \n\nsuch form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability \n\nto do so.  \n\n \nSection 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to \n\nany Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender \n\nshall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to \n\nassign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such \n\nLender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the \n\nfuture, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be \n\ndisadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in \n\nconnection with any such designation or assignment.  \n\n \nSection 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether \n\nvoluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it \n\n(other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the \n\nLoans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in \n\nthe Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably \n\nwith each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such \n\npurchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing \n\nLender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share \n\n(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered \n\nfrom the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of \n\nthe total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender \n\npursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including \n\nthe right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower \n\nor a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.  \n\n \nSection 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an \n\ninducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders \n\nits warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to \n\nadjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to \n\nbe substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, \n\nor delivered in substitution or exchange for  \n\n \n43 \n\n  \n    \n\nany thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to \n\nthe contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable \n\n(subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of \n\n\n\nthe Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each \n\ncase immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  \n\n \n(b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower \n\nwill issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each \n\nWarrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the \n\nClosing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder \n\na Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants \n\nto be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased \n\nby such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such \n\nWarrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such \n\nnotice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants \n\ndeliverable to such Warrantholder).  \n\n \n(c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-\n\n2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal \n\namount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue \n\nprice allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue \n\nprice and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated \n\nhereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent \n\njurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.  \n\n \nSection 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any \n\nGovernmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority \n\nof such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice \n\nthereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or \n\ncontinue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such  \n\n \n44 \n\n  \n\n \nLender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such \n\nLender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid \n\nsuch illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the \n\nBase Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain \n\nsuch LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such \n\nLIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates \n\nbased upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base \n\nRate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative \n\nAgent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the \n\namount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.  \n\n \nSection 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a \n\ncontinuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks \n\nin the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and \n\nreasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the \n\naffected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR \n\nRate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation \n\nof the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such \n\n\n\nnotice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).  \n\n \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in \n\nclause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with \n\nrespect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the \n\nImpacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected \n\nLenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and \n\nfairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has \n\nmade it unlawful, or that  \n\n \n45 \n\n  \n\n \nany Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine \n\nor charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the \n\nauthority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written \n\nnotice thereof.  \n\n \nSection 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change \n\nin Law shall:  \n\n \n(i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance \n\ncharge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or \n\nparticipated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;  \n\n \n(ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified \n\nTaxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection \n\nIncome Taxes); or  \n\n \n(iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense \n\naffecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or \n\nparticipation therein;  \n\n \nand the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing \n\nor maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case \n\nof clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such \n\nLender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, \n\ninterest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional \n\namount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  \n\n \n(b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or \n\nany Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity \n\nrequirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of \n\nsuch Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the \n\nLoans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have \n\nachieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such \n\nLender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such \n\nLender  \n\n \n46 \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\nsuch additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such \n\nreduction suffered.  \n\n \n(c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts \n\nnecessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) \n\nof this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such \n\nLender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.  \n\n \n(d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to \n\nthe foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such \n\ncompensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing \n\nprovisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the \n\ndate that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and \n\nof such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such \n\nincreased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include \n\nthe period of retroactive effect thereof).  \n\n \nSection 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative \n\nAgent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless \n\nfrom any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:  \n\n \n(a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of \n\nthe Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);  \n\n \n(b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to \n\nprepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or  \n\n \n(c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of \n\na request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;  \n\n \nexcluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment \n\nof funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds \n\nwere obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender \n\nin connection with the foregoing.  \n\n   \n\n47 \n\n  \n\n \nFor purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender \n\nshall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other \n\nborrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether \n\nor not such Loan was in fact so funded.  \n\n \nSection 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the \n\nBorrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental \n\nAuthority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is \n\nunable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender \n\nin accordance with Section 9.13.  \n\n \nSection 2.17.   Survival.   Each party’s obligations under Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 \n\nshall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Loan Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan \n\nDocuments, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.  \n\n \n\n\n\nArticle 3 \n\nRepresentations and Warranties  \n\n \nRepresentations and Warranties of the Borrower. In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent \n\nto enter into this Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make the Loans hereunder, the Borrower makes the following \n\nrepresentations and warranties as to itself and its Subsidiaries:  \n\n \nSection 3.01.   Existence and Power.   The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited \n\nliability company or limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its \n\njurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to do business in each additional jurisdiction necessary or advisable \n\nfor the conduct of its business, except for such failures to so qualify in such additional jurisdictions as would not, \n\nindividually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and each of \n\nits Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to own its Properties and to carry on its business as now being \n\nconducted and as proposed to be conducted. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational \n\npower to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants \n\nand the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower has all requisite organizational power to borrow \n\nthe Loans and issue the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Lenders and Warrantholders in accordance with \n\nthe terms hereof and thereof.  \n\n \n48 \n\n  \n    \n\nSection 3.02.

Such \n\nprojections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light \n\nof current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future \n\nfinancial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being \n\nacknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may \n\ncause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.  \n\n \n50 \n\n  \n    \n\n(d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of \n\nthe Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of \n\nthe historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been \n\ncompleted immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then \n\nended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial \n\nposition and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of \n\nbusiness on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date \n\nor at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to \n\nfairly reflect such assumptions.  \n\n \n(e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or \n\nwhich could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event \n\nwhich individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a \n\nDefault or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  \n\n \n\n\n\nSection 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.    (a) Except as set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.06, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened \n\nagainst or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties or rights which, if \n\nadversely determined, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse \n\nEffect.  \n\n \n(b)          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened \n\nagainst the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which seek to enjoin, or otherwise prevent the consummation of, the \n\ntransactions contemplated herein or to recover any damages or obtain any relief as a result of any of the transactions \n\ncontemplated herein in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority.  \n\n \n(c)          Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will be after giving effect to the \n\nconsummation of the Transactions, as the case may be, in default under or in violation of any Statute or Order, which \n\ndefault or violation, individually or in the aggregate together with all other such defaults and violations has had, or \n\ncould reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \nSection 3.07.   No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and \n\nits Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, \n\nissuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or  \n\n \n51 \n\n  \n\n \ncompliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the \n\nconsummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or \n\nprovisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to \n\nthe Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the \n\nOrganizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.  \n\n \nSection 3.08.   Consents, Etc.   No consent, approval or authorization of or declaration, registration or filing \n\nwith any Governmental Authority or any nongovernmental Person is required in connection with the execution or \n\ndelivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan \n\nDocuments or the performance by any such Person of its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or as a condition to the \n\nlegality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents, or \n\nthe consummation of any component of the Transactions, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, \n\ndeclarations, registrations or filings as are listed on Schedule 3.08, all of which have been or will on or prior to the \n\nClosing Date be obtained or made and are or will then be in full force and effect, and except those which the failure \n\nto obtain or make could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse \n\nEffect.  \n\n \nSection 3.09.    Outstanding Indebtedness.   Schedule 6.01(a) sets forth a correct and complete list and brief \n\ndescription of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness evidenced by the \n\nLoans) existing on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, in each case showing the aggregate \n\nprincipal amount thereof (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn commitments with respect thereto), the name of \n\nthe respective borrower and any other entity which directly or indirectly guarantees such debt and all Liens securing \n\nsuch Indebtedness.  \n\n \nSection 3.10.   Taxes.  The Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, has timely filed all U.S. federal \n\nand all material state, local and foreign tax returns, information returns and excise tax returns, forms and reports for \n\nTaxes (“Tax Returns”) with the appropriate Governmental Authority which were or are required to have been filed \n\nby or on behalf of any such Persons and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and accurately reflect in \n\n\n\nall material respects all liability for Taxes of the Borrower or Subsidiary taken as a whole for the periods covered \n\nthereby. All Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other material Taxes and assessments payable \n\nby the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof have been timely paid to the appropriate Governmental  \n\n    \n\n52 \n\n  \n    \n\nAuthority, unless such Tax liability is being diligently contested in good faith and the Borrower and/or the appropriate \n\nSubsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, has adequately reserved against such Tax liability on its books and financial \n\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted \n\nwith respect to any such Taxes as of the date hereof. No material Tax assessment against the Borrower, or any \n\nSubsidiary thereof has been proposed, formally or informally. The Tax liabilities of the Borrower and any Subsidiary \n\nthereof are adequately provided for on the relevant Person’s books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP.  \n\n \nSection 3.11.   Disclosure.   None of this Agreement nor any other document or certificate furnished to any \n\nLender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith (including the Financial \n\nStatements), taken in the aggregate, contained, as of its respective date and as of the Closing Date, and no document \n\nor certificate which shall be furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in \n\nconnection herewith, when taken as a whole with, all documents and certificates previously delivered, shall contain, \n\nas of its date of delivery, any untrue statement of a material fact, or as of any such date omitted to state a material fact \n\nnecessary in order to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they \n\nwere made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents \n\nonly that such information was prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it \n\nbeing acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which \n\nmay cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary from the projected results. Neither the \n\nBorrower nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any facts (other than matters of a general economic or political nature) \n\nthat individually or in the aggregate have had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \nSection 3.12.    Margin Regulations.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or intends to \n\nacquire any “margin stock” as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of \n\nthe United States (12 CFR 207). No part of the proceeds of the Loans or the Warrants will be used, and no part of the \n\nproceeds of any loans repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the Loans or the Warrants was used, directly or \n\nindirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board \n\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or \n\ncarrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in \n\na violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation \n\nT of said Board (12 CFR 220). Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries or any agent acting on its behalf has \n\ntaken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or the Loans to violate  \n\n \n53 \n\n  \n\n \nRegulation U, Regulation X, Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n\nSystem of the United States or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter \n\nbe in effect. As used in this Section 3.12, the term “purpose of buying or carrying” has the meaning assigned thereto \n\nin the aforesaid Regulation U.  \n\n \nSection 3.13.   Pension and Benefit Plans.   (a) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material \n\nAdverse Effect, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, each of the Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates is in \n\ncompliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published interpretations \n\nthereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other \n\nsuch ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no Unfunded \n\nPension Liability with respect to any Plans that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \n\n\n\n(b)          Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign \n\nPension Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all requirements of law applicable thereto and the respective \n\nrequirements of the governing documents for such plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material \n\nAdverse Effect, With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, none of the Borrower, any Subsidiaries or any of their \n\nrespective directors, officers, employees or agents has engaged in a transaction which would subject the Borrower or \n\nany Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to a tax or civil penalty. With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, reserves \n\nhave been established in the financial statements furnished to Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities in \n\naccordance with applicable law and prudent business practice or, where required, in accordance with ordinary \n\naccounting practices in the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Pension Plan is maintained. The aggregate unfunded \n\nliabilities with respect to Foreign Pension Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect \n\nassuming proper funding and administration of such foreign Pension Plans on an ongoing basis.  \n\n \nSection 3.14.     Labor Matters.   As of the date hereof and the Closing Date, there are no strikes, lockouts or \n\nslowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge the Borrower, threatened. The hours \n\nworked by and payments made to employees of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the \n\nFair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters. All \n\npayments due from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any \n\nSubsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or \n\naccrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions will \n\nnot give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation  \n\n    \n\n54 \n\n  \n\n \non the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.  \n\n \nSection 3.15.

Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor the use or sale of any of their products or \n\nthe provision of any of their services, has materially infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the IP Rights of \n\nany Person. No claim, action, suit or proceeding regarding any IP Rights is pending or, to the knowledge of the \n\nBorrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.  \n\n \nSection 3.17.

Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is an “investment \n\ncompany” or a “person directly or indirectly controlled by or acting on behalf of an investment company” within the \n\nmeaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  \n\n \nSection 3.20.   Ranking of Loans.   The Indebtedness represented by the Loans and the other Loan Obligations \n\nunder the applicable Loan Documents of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties is intended to constitute senior \n\nIndebtedness, and accordingly is, and shall be, at all times while the Loans and the other Loan Obligations remain \n\noutstanding senior in right of payment to, or pari passu with, all Indebtedness of the Loan Parties.  \n\n \nSection 3.21.   Solvency.   The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are Solvent on the Closing \n\nDate both before and after giving effect to the Transactions to be effected on the Closing Date and the application of \n\nthe net proceeds of the Loans and the Warrants.  \n\n \nSection 3.22.     Restrictions on or Relating to Subsidiaries.   There does not exist any encumbrance or \n\nrestriction on the ability of (x) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to pay dividends or make any other distributions on its \n\nCapital Stock or any other interest or participation in its profits owned by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, or \n\nto pay any Indebtedness owed to the Borrower or a Subsidiary thereof, (y) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to make \n\nloans or advances to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof or (z) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to transfer any of \n\nits properties or assets to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, except for such encumbrances or restrictions existing \n\nunder or by reason of (i) applicable law, (ii) the Loan Documents with respect to clause (z) only, Liens permitted to \n\nexist pursuant to Section 6.02 and (iii) with respect to clause (z) only, customary restrictions on assignment, subletting \n\nor transfer in any lease, license or contract.

If and to the extent the Borrower \n\nshall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the \n\nAdministrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for \n\neach day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to \n\nthe Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.  \n\n \n(e)         The Loan Parties’ obligation to pay all amounts due hereunder and under any other Loan Documents \n\nshall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including:  \n\n \n(i)         any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, deduction, abatement, suspension, diminution, \n\nreduction, defense or other right which any Loan Party may have against any supplier, whether such supplier \n\nwas paid from the proceeds of Loans or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever arising under or pursuant to \n\nany supply agreement or otherwise relating to the purchase of goods, other property or services from or by \n\nany such supplier;  \n\n\n\n \n(ii)         any defect in the condition, design, operation, or fitness for use of, or any damage to \n\nor loss or destruction of, any equipment or material provided by any such supplier;  \n\n \n(iii)         any actual or alleged default by any such supplier or any other Person under any \n\nsupply agreement; or  \n\n \n(iv)         any other fact or circumstance relating to any supply agreement.  \n\n \nSection 2.08.

(a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any \n\nobligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or \n\nwithholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings \n\nor other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, \n\nadditions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be \n\nrequired by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case \n\nmay be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender  \n\n    \n\n39 \n\n  \n    \n\nor the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party \n\nshall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made \n\nall required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable \n\nunder this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the \n\nsum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all \n\nsuch deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant \n\nGovernmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  \n\n \n(b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or \n\nfuture stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or \n\nfrom the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a \n\nsecurity interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).  \n\n \n(c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them \n\nharmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent \n\n(as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such \n\nIndemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This \n\nindemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may \n\nbe) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the \n\nBorrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or \n\non behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  \n\n \nEach Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for \n\n(i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already \n\nindemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure \n\nto comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) \n\nany Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in \n\nconnection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not \n\nsuch Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from \n\nthe Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent \n\nmanifest error.  \n\n    \n\n40 \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n(d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the \n\nAdministrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such \n\nother evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.  \n\n \n(e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding \n\nTax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative \n\nAgent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly \n\ncompleted and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will \n\npermit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if \n\nreasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed \n\nby applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower \n\nor the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information \n\nreporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, \n\nexecution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), \n\n(ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or \n\nsubmission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice \n\nthe legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender \n\nthat is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such \n\nLender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the \n\nBorrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt \n\nfrom U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, \n\ndeliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) \n\non or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is \n\napplicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States \n\nis a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-\n\n8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the \n\n“interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, \n\nIRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\npursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)  \n\n    \n\n41 \n\n  \n\n \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption \n\nfor portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the \n\neffect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent \n\nshareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign \n\ncorporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed \n\noriginals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a \n\nU.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other \n\ncertification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership \n\nand one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such \n\nForeign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of \n\neach such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver \n\nto the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or \n\nprior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other \n\nform prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding \n\nTax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to \n\npermit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and \n\n(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\n\n\nimposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA \n\n(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the \n\nBorrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably \n\nrequested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including \n\nas prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by \n\nthe Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to \n\ncomply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s \n\nobligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes \n\nof this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each \n\nLender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any \n\nrespect, it shall update  \n\n    \n\n42 \n\n  \n    \n\nsuch form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability \n\nto do so.  \n\n \nSection 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to \n\nany Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender \n\nshall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to \n\nassign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such \n\nLender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the \n\nfuture, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be \n\ndisadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in \n\nconnection with any such designation or assignment.  \n\n \nSection 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether \n\nvoluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it \n\n(other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the \n\nLoans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in \n\nthe Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably \n\nwith each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such \n\npurchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing \n\nLender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share \n\n(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered \n\nfrom the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of \n\nthe total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender \n\npursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including \n\nthe right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower \n\nor a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.  \n\n \nSection 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an \n\ninducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders \n\nits warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to \n\nadjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to \n\nbe substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, \n\nor delivered in substitution or exchange for  \n\n \n43 \n\n  \n    \n\nany thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to \n\nthe contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable \n\n(subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of \n\n\n\nthe Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each \n\ncase immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  \n\n \n(b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower \n\nwill issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each \n\nWarrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the \n\nClosing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder \n\na Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants \n\nto be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased \n\nby such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such \n\nWarrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such \n\nnotice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants \n\ndeliverable to such Warrantholder).  \n\n \n(c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-\n\n2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal \n\namount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue \n\nprice allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue \n\nprice and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated \n\nhereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent \n\njurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.  \n\n \nSection 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any \n\nGovernmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority \n\nof such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice \n\nthereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or \n\ncontinue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such  \n\n \n44 \n\n  \n\n \nLender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such \n\nLender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid \n\nsuch illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the \n\nBase Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain \n\nsuch LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such \n\nLIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates \n\nbased upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base \n\nRate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative \n\nAgent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the \n\namount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.  \n\n \nSection 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a \n\ncontinuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks \n\nin the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and \n\nreasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the \n\naffected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR \n\nRate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation \n\nof the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such \n\n\n\nnotice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).  \n\n \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in \n\nclause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with \n\nrespect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the \n\nImpacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected \n\nLenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and \n\nfairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has \n\nmade it unlawful, or that  \n\n \n45 \n\n  \n\n \nany Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine \n\nor charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the \n\nauthority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written \n\nnotice thereof.  \n\n \nSection 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change \n\nin Law shall:  \n\n \n(i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance \n\ncharge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or \n\nparticipated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;  \n\n \n(ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified \n\nTaxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection \n\nIncome Taxes); or  \n\n \n(iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense \n\naffecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or \n\nparticipation therein;  \n\n \nand the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing \n\nor maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case \n\nof clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such \n\nLender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, \n\ninterest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional \n\namount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  \n\n \n(b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or \n\nany Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity \n\nrequirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of \n\nsuch Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the \n\nLoans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have \n\nachieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such \n\nLender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such \n\nLender  \n\n \n46 \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\nsuch additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such \n\nreduction suffered.  \n\n \n(c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts \n\nnecessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) \n\nof this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such \n\nLender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.  \n\n \n(d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to \n\nthe foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such \n\ncompensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing \n\nprovisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the \n\ndate that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and \n\nof such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such \n\nincreased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include \n\nthe period of retroactive effect thereof).  \n\n \nSection 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative \n\nAgent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless \n\nfrom any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:  \n\n \n(a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of \n\nthe Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);  \n\n \n(b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to \n\nprepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or  \n\n \n(c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of \n\na request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;  \n\n \nexcluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment \n\nof funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds \n\nwere obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender \n\nin connection with the foregoing.  \n\n   \n\n47 \n\n  \n\n \nFor purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender \n\nshall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other \n\nborrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether \n\nor not such Loan was in fact so funded.  \n\n \nSection 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the \n\nBorrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental \n\nAuthority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is \n\nunable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender \n\nin accordance with Section 9.13.  \n\n \nSection 2.17.   Survival.   Each party’s obligations under Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 \n\nshall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Loan Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan \n\nDocuments, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.  \n\n \n\n\n\nArticle 3 \n\nRepresentations and Warranties  \n\n \nRepresentations and Warranties of the Borrower. In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent \n\nto enter into this Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make the Loans hereunder, the Borrower makes the following \n\nrepresentations and warranties as to itself and its Subsidiaries:  \n\n \nSection 3.01.   Existence and Power.   The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited \n\nliability company or limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its \n\njurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to do business in each additional jurisdiction necessary or advisable \n\nfor the conduct of its business, except for such failures to so qualify in such additional jurisdictions as would not, \n\nindividually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and each of \n\nits Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to own its Properties and to carry on its business as now being \n\nconducted and as proposed to be conducted. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational \n\npower to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants \n\nand the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower has all requisite organizational power to borrow \n\nthe Loans and issue the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Lenders and Warrantholders in accordance with \n\nthe terms hereof and thereof.  \n\n \n48 \n\n  \n    \n\nSection 3.02.

Such \n\nprojections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light \n\nof current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future \n\nfinancial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being \n\nacknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may \n\ncause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.  \n\n \n50 \n\n  \n    \n\n(d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of \n\nthe Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of \n\nthe historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been \n\ncompleted immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then \n\nended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial \n\nposition and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of \n\nbusiness on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date \n\nor at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to \n\nfairly reflect such assumptions.  \n\n \n(e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or \n\nwhich could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event \n\nwhich individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a \n\nDefault or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  \n\n \n\n\n\nSection 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.    (a) Except as set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.06, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened \n\nagainst or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties or rights which, if \n\nadversely determined, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse \n\nEffect.  \n\n \n(b)          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened \n\nagainst the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which seek to enjoin, or otherwise prevent the consummation of, the \n\ntransactions contemplated herein or to recover any damages or obtain any relief as a result of any of the transactions \n\ncontemplated herein in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority.  \n\n \n(c)          Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will be after giving effect to the \n\nconsummation of the Transactions, as the case may be, in default under or in violation of any Statute or Order, which \n\ndefault or violation, individually or in the aggregate together with all other such defaults and violations has had, or \n\ncould reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \nSection 3.07.   No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and \n\nits Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, \n\nissuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or  \n\n \n51 \n\n  \n\n \ncompliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the \n\nconsummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or \n\nprovisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to \n\nthe Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the \n\nOrganizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.  \n\n \nSection 3.08.   Consents, Etc.   No consent, approval or authorization of or declaration, registration or filing \n\nwith any Governmental Authority or any nongovernmental Person is required in connection with the execution or \n\ndelivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan \n\nDocuments or the performance by any such Person of its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or as a condition to the \n\nlegality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents, or \n\nthe consummation of any component of the Transactions, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, \n\ndeclarations, registrations or filings as are listed on Schedule 3.08, all of which have been or will on or prior to the \n\nClosing Date be obtained or made and are or will then be in full force and effect, and except those which the failure \n\nto obtain or make could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse \n\nEffect.  \n\n \nSection 3.09.    Outstanding Indebtedness.   Schedule 6.01(a) sets forth a correct and complete list and brief \n\ndescription of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness evidenced by the \n\nLoans) existing on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, in each case showing the aggregate \n\nprincipal amount thereof (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn commitments with respect thereto), the name of \n\nthe respective borrower and any other entity which directly or indirectly guarantees such debt and all Liens securing \n\nsuch Indebtedness.  \n\n \nSection 3.10.   Taxes.  The Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, has timely filed all U.S. federal \n\nand all material state, local and foreign tax returns, information returns and excise tax returns, forms and reports for \n\nTaxes (“Tax Returns”) with the appropriate Governmental Authority which were or are required to have been filed \n\nby or on behalf of any such Persons and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and accurately reflect in \n\n\n\nall material respects all liability for Taxes of the Borrower or Subsidiary taken as a whole for the periods covered \n\nthereby. All Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other material Taxes and assessments payable \n\nby the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof have been timely paid to the appropriate Governmental  \n\n    \n\n52 \n\n  \n    \n\nAuthority, unless such Tax liability is being diligently contested in good faith and the Borrower and/or the appropriate \n\nSubsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, has adequately reserved against such Tax liability on its books and financial \n\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted \n\nwith respect to any such Taxes as of the date hereof. No material Tax assessment against the Borrower, or any \n\nSubsidiary thereof has been proposed, formally or informally. The Tax liabilities of the Borrower and any Subsidiary \n\nthereof are adequately provided for on the relevant Person’s books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP.  \n\n \nSection 3.11.   Disclosure.   None of this Agreement nor any other document or certificate furnished to any \n\nLender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith (including the Financial \n\nStatements), taken in the aggregate, contained, as of its respective date and as of the Closing Date, and no document \n\nor certificate which shall be furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in \n\nconnection herewith, when taken as a whole with, all documents and certificates previously delivered, shall contain, \n\nas of its date of delivery, any untrue statement of a material fact, or as of any such date omitted to state a material fact \n\nnecessary in order to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they \n\nwere made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents \n\nonly that such information was prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it \n\nbeing acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which \n\nmay cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary from the projected results. Neither the \n\nBorrower nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any facts (other than matters of a general economic or political nature) \n\nthat individually or in the aggregate have had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \nSection 3.12.    Margin Regulations.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or intends to \n\nacquire any “margin stock” as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of \n\nthe United States (12 CFR 207). No part of the proceeds of the Loans or the Warrants will be used, and no part of the \n\nproceeds of any loans repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the Loans or the Warrants was used, directly or \n\nindirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board \n\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or \n\ncarrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in \n\na violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation \n\nT of said Board (12 CFR 220). Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries or any agent acting on its behalf has \n\ntaken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or the Loans to violate  \n\n \n53 \n\n  \n\n \nRegulation U, Regulation X, Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n\nSystem of the United States or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter \n\nbe in effect. As used in this Section 3.12, the term “purpose of buying or carrying” has the meaning assigned thereto \n\nin the aforesaid Regulation U.  \n\n \nSection 3.13.   Pension and Benefit Plans.   (a) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material \n\nAdverse Effect, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, each of the Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates is in \n\ncompliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published interpretations \n\nthereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other \n\nsuch ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no Unfunded \n\nPension Liability with respect to any Plans that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \n\n\n\n(b)          Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign \n\nPension Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all requirements of law applicable thereto and the respective \n\nrequirements of the governing documents for such plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material \n\nAdverse Effect, With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, none of the Borrower, any Subsidiaries or any of their \n\nrespective directors, officers, employees or agents has engaged in a transaction which would subject the Borrower or \n\nany Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to a tax or civil penalty. With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, reserves \n\nhave been established in the financial statements furnished to Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities in \n\naccordance with applicable law and prudent business practice or, where required, in accordance with ordinary \n\naccounting practices in the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Pension Plan is maintained. The aggregate unfunded \n\nliabilities with respect to Foreign Pension Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect \n\nassuming proper funding and administration of such foreign Pension Plans on an ongoing basis.  \n\n \nSection 3.14.     Labor Matters.   As of the date hereof and the Closing Date, there are no strikes, lockouts or \n\nslowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge the Borrower, threatened. The hours \n\nworked by and payments made to employees of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the \n\nFair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters. All \n\npayments due from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any \n\nSubsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or \n\naccrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions will \n\nnot give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation  \n\n    \n\n54 \n\n  \n\n \non the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.  \n\n \nSection 3.15.

Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor the use or sale of any of their products or \n\nthe provision of any of their services, has materially infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the IP Rights of \n\nany Person. No claim, action, suit or proceeding regarding any IP Rights is pending or, to the knowledge of the \n\nBorrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.  \n\n \nSection 3.17.

Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is an “investment \n\ncompany” or a “person directly or indirectly controlled by or acting on behalf of an investment company” within the \n\nmeaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  \n\n \nSection 3.20.   Ranking of Loans.   The Indebtedness represented by the Loans and the other Loan Obligations \n\nunder the applicable Loan Documents of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties is intended to constitute senior \n\nIndebtedness, and accordingly is, and shall be, at all times while the Loans and the other Loan Obligations remain \n\noutstanding senior in right of payment to, or pari passu with, all Indebtedness of the Loan Parties.  \n\n \nSection 3.21.   Solvency.   The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are Solvent on the Closing \n\nDate both before and after giving effect to the Transactions to be effected on the Closing Date and the application of \n\nthe net proceeds of the Loans and the Warrants.  \n\n \nSection 3.22.     Restrictions on or Relating to Subsidiaries.   There does not exist any encumbrance or \n\nrestriction on the ability of (x) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to pay dividends or make any other distributions on its \n\nCapital Stock or any other interest or participation in its profits owned by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, or \n\nto pay any Indebtedness owed to the Borrower or a Subsidiary thereof, (y) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to make \n\nloans or advances to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof or (z) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to transfer any of \n\nits properties or assets to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, except for such encumbrances or restrictions existing \n\nunder or by reason of (i) applicable law, (ii) the Loan Documents with respect to clause (z) only, Liens permitted to \n\nexist pursuant to Section 6.02 and (iii) with respect to clause (z) only, customary restrictions on assignment, subletting \n\nor transfer in any lease, license or contract.

If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be \n\nrequired by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case \n\nmay be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender  \n\n    \n\n39 \n\n  \n    \n\nor the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party \n\nshall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made \n\nall required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable \n\nunder this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the \n\nsum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all \n\nsuch deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant \n\nGovernmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  \n\n \n(b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or \n\nfuture stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or \n\nfrom the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a \n\nsecurity interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).  \n\n \n(c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them \n\nharmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent \n\n(as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such \n\nIndemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This \n\nindemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may \n\nbe) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the \n\nBorrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or \n\non behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  \n\n \nEach Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for \n\n(i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already \n\nindemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure \n\nto comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) \n\nany Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in \n\nconnection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not \n\nsuch Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from \n\nthe Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent \n\nmanifest error.  \n\n    \n\n40 \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n(d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the \n\nAdministrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such \n\nother evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.  \n\n \n(e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding \n\nTax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative \n\nAgent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly \n\ncompleted and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will \n\npermit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if \n\nreasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed \n\nby applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower \n\nor the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information \n\nreporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, \n\nexecution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), \n\n(ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or \n\nsubmission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice \n\nthe legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender \n\nthat is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such \n\nLender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the \n\nBorrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt \n\nfrom U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, \n\ndeliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) \n\non or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is \n\napplicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States \n\nis a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-\n\n8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the \n\n“interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, \n\nIRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\npursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)  \n\n    \n\n41 \n\n  \n\n \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption \n\nfor portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the \n\neffect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent \n\nshareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign \n\ncorporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed \n\noriginals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a \n\nU.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other \n\ncertification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership \n\nand one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such \n\nForeign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of \n\neach such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver \n\nto the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or \n\nprior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other \n\nform prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding \n\nTax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to \n\npermit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and \n\n(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\n\n\nimposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA \n\n(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the \n\nBorrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably \n\nrequested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including \n\nas prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by \n\nthe Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to \n\ncomply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s \n\nobligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes \n\nof this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each \n\nLender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any \n\nrespect, it shall update  \n\n    \n\n42 \n\n  \n    \n\nsuch form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability \n\nto do so.  \n\n \nSection 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to \n\nany Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender \n\nshall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to \n\nassign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such \n\nLender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the \n\nfuture, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be \n\ndisadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in \n\nconnection with any such designation or assignment.  \n\n \nSection 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether \n\nvoluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it \n\n(other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the \n\nLoans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in \n\nthe Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably \n\nwith each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such \n\npurchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing \n\nLender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share \n\n(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered \n\nfrom the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of \n\nthe total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender \n\npursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including \n\nthe right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower \n\nor a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.  \n\n \nSection 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an \n\ninducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders \n\nits warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to \n\nadjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to \n\nbe substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, \n\nor delivered in substitution or exchange for  \n\n \n43 \n\n  \n    \n\nany thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to \n\nthe contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable \n\n(subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of \n\n\n\nthe Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each \n\ncase immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  \n\n \n(b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower \n\nwill issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each \n\nWarrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the \n\nClosing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder \n\na Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants \n\nto be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased \n\nby such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such \n\nWarrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such \n\nnotice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants \n\ndeliverable to such Warrantholder).  \n\n \n(c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-\n\n2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal \n\namount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue \n\nprice allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue \n\nprice and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated \n\nhereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent \n\njurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.  \n\n \nSection 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any \n\nGovernmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority \n\nof such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice \n\nthereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or \n\ncontinue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such  \n\n \n44 \n\n  \n\n \nLender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such \n\nLender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid \n\nsuch illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the \n\nBase Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain \n\nsuch LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such \n\nLIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates \n\nbased upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base \n\nRate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative \n\nAgent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the \n\namount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.  \n\n \nSection 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a \n\ncontinuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks \n\nin the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and \n\nreasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the \n\naffected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR \n\nRate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation \n\nof the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such \n\n\n\nnotice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).  \n\n \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in \n\nclause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with \n\nrespect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the \n\nImpacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected \n\nLenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and \n\nfairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has \n\nmade it unlawful, or that  \n\n \n45 \n\n  \n\n \nany Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine \n\nor charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the \n\nauthority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written \n\nnotice thereof.  \n\n \nSection 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change \n\nin Law shall:  \n\n \n(i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance \n\ncharge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or \n\nparticipated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;  \n\n \n(ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified \n\nTaxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection \n\nIncome Taxes); or  \n\n \n(iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense \n\naffecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or \n\nparticipation therein;  \n\n \nand the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing \n\nor maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case \n\nof clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such \n\nLender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, \n\ninterest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional \n\namount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  \n\n \n(b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or \n\nany Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity \n\nrequirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of \n\nsuch Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the \n\nLoans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have \n\nachieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such \n\nLender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such \n\nLender  \n\n \n46 \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\nsuch additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such \n\nreduction suffered.  \n\n \n(c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts \n\nnecessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) \n\nof this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such \n\nLender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.  \n\n \n(d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to \n\nthe foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such \n\ncompensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing \n\nprovisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the \n\ndate that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and \n\nof such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such \n\nincreased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include \n\nthe period of retroactive effect thereof).  \n\n \nSection 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative \n\nAgent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless \n\nfrom any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:  \n\n \n(a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of \n\nthe Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);  \n\n \n(b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to \n\nprepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or  \n\n \n(c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of \n\na request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;  \n\n \nexcluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment \n\nof funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds \n\nwere obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender \n\nin connection with the foregoing.  \n\n   \n\n47 \n\n  \n\n \nFor purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender \n\nshall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other \n\nborrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether \n\nor not such Loan was in fact so funded.  \n\n \nSection 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the \n\nBorrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental \n\nAuthority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is \n\nunable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender \n\nin accordance with Section 9.13.  \n\n \nSection 2.17.   Survival.   Each party’s obligations under Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 \n\nshall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Loan Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan \n\nDocuments, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.  \n\n \n\n\n\nArticle 3 \n\nRepresentations and Warranties  \n\n \nRepresentations and Warranties of the Borrower. In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent \n\nto enter into this Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make the Loans hereunder, the Borrower makes the following \n\nrepresentations and warranties as to itself and its Subsidiaries:  \n\n \nSection 3.01.   Existence and Power.   The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited \n\nliability company or limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its \n\njurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to do business in each additional jurisdiction necessary or advisable \n\nfor the conduct of its business, except for such failures to so qualify in such additional jurisdictions as would not, \n\nindividually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and each of \n\nits Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to own its Properties and to carry on its business as now being \n\nconducted and as proposed to be conducted. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational \n\npower to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants \n\nand the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower has all requisite organizational power to borrow \n\nthe Loans and issue the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Lenders and Warrantholders in accordance with \n\nthe terms hereof and thereof.  \n\n \n48 \n\n  \n    \n\nSection 3.02.

Each of this \n\nAgreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the \n\nBorrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto enforceable against such Person in accordance with its respective \n\nterms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, \n\nor other laws relative to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally in effect from time to time and by \n\ngeneral principles of equity whether applied in equity or at law.  \n\n \nSection 3.04.

As of the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, \n\nall of the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be validly \n\nissued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to any pre-emptive rights and owned of record and beneficially \n\nby the Persons listed on Schedule 3.04(a) free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.  \n\n \n(b)          As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, except as set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.04(a), neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of Capital Stock of, or have any \n\ndirect or indirect equity interest in, any other Person.  \n\n \n(c)           Except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(c), as of the Closing Date and after giving effect to the \n\nTransactions, there are no securities outstanding that are convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of Capital \n\nStock of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, nor are there outstanding any rights to subscribe for or purchase, or \n\nany options or warrants for the purchase of, or any agreements (contingent or otherwise) providing for the issuance \n\nof, or any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to, any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower  \n\n\n\n    \n\n49 \n\n  \n    \n\nor any of its Subsidiaries or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares.  \n\n \n(d)          On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of the Borrower or any of its \n\nSubsidiaries shall be subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase, acquire or retire (i) any of its \n\nCapital Stock, (ii) any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any of its Capital Stock, or (iii) any options, \n\nwarrants or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire any of its Capital Stock.  \n\n \nSection 3.05.   Business Operations and Other Information;   Financial Condition; No Material Adverse \n\nEffect. (a) The Borrower has heretofore delivered or caused to be delivered to each Lender copies of the Audited \n\nFinancial Statements (the “Financial Statements”). The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with \n\nGAAP (except as otherwise noted therein), consistently applied, and subject, in the case of each of the Financial \n\nStatements that are unaudited, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes, and \n\npresent fairly in all material respects the Consolidated financial position and related Consolidated income, \n\nstockholders’ equity and cash flows (as applicable) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at each of the dates and for \n\neach of the periods respectively covered thereby.  \n\n \n(b)          As of December 31, 2013, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries had any Indebtedness or \n\nliability, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or any Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities, \n\nliabilities for material taxes, long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, except as reflected or \n\nreserved against on the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements or described in the notes thereto.  \n\n \n(c)          Attached as Schedule 3.05(c) is a copy of the latest (as of the Closing Date) projections of the \n\nconsolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flow of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (assuming \n\nconsummation of the Transactions) for each of the fiscal years of the Borrower in the period from the Closing Date \n\nthrough 2015, including a detailed cash flow forecast for the 12-month period following the Closing Date. Such \n\nprojections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light \n\nof current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future \n\nfinancial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being \n\nacknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may \n\ncause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.  \n\n \n50 \n\n  \n    \n\n(d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of \n\nthe Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of \n\nthe historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been \n\ncompleted immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then \n\nended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial \n\nposition and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of \n\nbusiness on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date \n\nor at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to \n\nfairly reflect such assumptions.  \n\n \n(e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or \n\nwhich could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event \n\nwhich individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a \n\nDefault or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  \n\n \n\n\n\nSection 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.    (a) Except as set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.06, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened \n\nagainst or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties or rights which, if \n\nadversely determined, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse \n\nEffect.  \n\n \n(b)          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened \n\nagainst the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which seek to enjoin, or otherwise prevent the consummation of, the \n\ntransactions contemplated herein or to recover any damages or obtain any relief as a result of any of the transactions \n\ncontemplated herein in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority.  \n\n \n(c)          Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will be after giving effect to the \n\nconsummation of the Transactions, as the case may be, in default under or in violation of any Statute or Order, which \n\ndefault or violation, individually or in the aggregate together with all other such defaults and violations has had, or \n\ncould reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \nSection 3.07.   No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and \n\nits Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, \n\nissuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or  \n\n \n51 \n\n  \n\n \ncompliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the \n\nconsummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or \n\nprovisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to \n\nthe Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the \n\nOrganizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.  \n\n \nSection 3.08.   Consents, Etc.   No consent, approval or authorization of or declaration, registration or filing \n\nwith any Governmental Authority or any nongovernmental Person is required in connection with the execution or \n\ndelivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan \n\nDocuments or the performance by any such Person of its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or as a condition to the \n\nlegality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents, or \n\nthe consummation of any component of the Transactions, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, \n\ndeclarations, registrations or filings as are listed on Schedule 3.08, all of which have been or will on or prior to the \n\nClosing Date be obtained or made and are or will then be in full force and effect, and except those which the failure \n\nto obtain or make could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse \n\nEffect.  \n\n \nSection 3.09.    Outstanding Indebtedness.   Schedule 6.01(a) sets forth a correct and complete list and brief \n\ndescription of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness evidenced by the \n\nLoans) existing on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, in each case showing the aggregate \n\nprincipal amount thereof (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn commitments with respect thereto), the name of \n\nthe respective borrower and any other entity which directly or indirectly guarantees such debt and all Liens securing \n\nsuch Indebtedness.  \n\n \nSection 3.10.   Taxes.  The Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, has timely filed all U.S. federal \n\nand all material state, local and foreign tax returns, information returns and excise tax returns, forms and reports for \n\nTaxes (“Tax Returns”) with the appropriate Governmental Authority which were or are required to have been filed \n\nby or on behalf of any such Persons and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and accurately reflect in \n\n\n\nall material respects all liability for Taxes of the Borrower or Subsidiary taken as a whole for the periods covered \n\nthereby. All Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other material Taxes and assessments payable \n\nby the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof have been timely paid to the appropriate Governmental  \n\n    \n\n52 \n\n  \n    \n\nAuthority, unless such Tax liability is being diligently contested in good faith and the Borrower and/or the appropriate \n\nSubsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, has adequately reserved against such Tax liability on its books and financial \n\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted \n\nwith respect to any such Taxes as of the date hereof. No material Tax assessment against the Borrower, or any \n\nSubsidiary thereof has been proposed, formally or informally. The Tax liabilities of the Borrower and any Subsidiary \n\nthereof are adequately provided for on the relevant Person’s books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP.  \n\n \nSection 3.11.   Disclosure.   None of this Agreement nor any other document or certificate furnished to any \n\nLender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith (including the Financial \n\nStatements), taken in the aggregate, contained, as of its respective date and as of the Closing Date, and no document \n\nor certificate which shall be furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in \n\nconnection herewith, when taken as a whole with, all documents and certificates previously delivered, shall contain, \n\nas of its date of delivery, any untrue statement of a material fact, or as of any such date omitted to state a material fact \n\nnecessary in order to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they \n\nwere made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents \n\nonly that such information was prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it \n\nbeing acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which \n\nmay cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary from the projected results. Neither the \n\nBorrower nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any facts (other than matters of a general economic or political nature) \n\nthat individually or in the aggregate have had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \nSection 3.12.    Margin Regulations.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or intends to \n\nacquire any “margin stock” as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of \n\nthe United States (12 CFR 207). No part of the proceeds of the Loans or the Warrants will be used, and no part of the \n\nproceeds of any loans repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the Loans or the Warrants was used, directly or \n\nindirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board \n\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or \n\ncarrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in \n\na violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation \n\nT of said Board (12 CFR 220). Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries or any agent acting on its behalf has \n\ntaken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or the Loans to violate  \n\n \n53 \n\n  \n\n \nRegulation U, Regulation X, Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n\nSystem of the United States or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter \n\nbe in effect. As used in this Section 3.12, the term “purpose of buying or carrying” has the meaning assigned thereto \n\nin the aforesaid Regulation U.  \n\n \nSection 3.13.   Pension and Benefit Plans.   (a) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material \n\nAdverse Effect, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, each of the Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates is in \n\ncompliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published interpretations \n\nthereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other \n\nsuch ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no Unfunded \n\nPension Liability with respect to any Plans that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \n\n\n\n(b)          Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign \n\nPension Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all requirements of law applicable thereto and the respective \n\nrequirements of the governing documents for such plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material \n\nAdverse Effect, With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, none of the Borrower, any Subsidiaries or any of their \n\nrespective directors, officers, employees or agents has engaged in a transaction which would subject the Borrower or \n\nany Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to a tax or civil penalty. With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, reserves \n\nhave been established in the financial statements furnished to Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities in \n\naccordance with applicable law and prudent business practice or, where required, in accordance with ordinary \n\naccounting practices in the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Pension Plan is maintained. The aggregate unfunded \n\nliabilities with respect to Foreign Pension Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect \n\nassuming proper funding and administration of such foreign Pension Plans on an ongoing basis.  \n\n \nSection 3.14.     Labor Matters.   As of the date hereof and the Closing Date, there are no strikes, lockouts or \n\nslowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge the Borrower, threatened. The hours \n\nworked by and payments made to employees of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the \n\nFair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters. All \n\npayments due from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any \n\nSubsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or \n\naccrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions will \n\nnot give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation  \n\n    \n\n54 \n\n  \n\n \non the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.  \n\n \nSection 3.15.

Ranking of Loans.   The Indebtedness represented by the Loans and the other Loan Obligations \n\nunder the applicable Loan Documents of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties is intended to constitute senior \n\nIndebtedness, and accordingly is, and shall be, at all times while the Loans and the other Loan Obligations remain \n\noutstanding senior in right of payment to, or pari passu with, all Indebtedness of the Loan Parties.  \n\n \nSection 3.21.   Solvency.   The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are Solvent on the Closing \n\nDate both before and after giving effect to the Transactions to be effected on the Closing Date and the application of \n\nthe net proceeds of the Loans and the Warrants.  \n\n \nSection 3.22.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no \n\nAgent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship \n\nwith any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read \n\ninto this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against each applicable Agent. It is understood \n\nand agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with \n\nreference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under \n\nagency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to \n\ncreate or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. Each Lender hereby irrevocably \n\nauthorizes the Collateral Agent to execute and deliver any documents necessary or appropriate (as determined by the \n\n\n\nLenders) to create rights of pledge governed by the laws of the Netherlands for the benefit of the Lenders and the \n\nAgents including, without limitation, a pledge on 65% of the outstanding voting Capital Stock of RTRX International \n\nC.V. pursuant to a Dutch-law governed Foreign Pledge Agreement among certain Subsidiaries of the Borrower and \n\nthe Collateral Agent (the “Dutch CV Pledge”). Without prejudice to the provisions of this  \n\n \n88 \n\n  \n    \n\nAgreement and the other Loan Documents, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree with the creation of a parallel \n\ndebt obligation of the Pledgors as will be described in the Parallel Debt(s) (both as defined in the Dutch CV Pledge) \n\nincluding that any payment received by the Collateral Agent in respect of the Parallel Debt(s) will be deemed a \n\nsatisfaction of a pro rata portion of the corresponding amounts of the Loan Obligations. The provisions of this Article \n\nare solely for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have \n\nrights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions.  \n\n \nSection 8.02.   Delegation of Duties.  Each Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights \n\nand powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub agents appointed by \n\nsuch Agent, and shall be entitled to the advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Each Agent \n\nand any such sub agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their \n\nrespective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub agent and to the \n\nRelated Parties of each Agent and any such sub agent. No Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct \n\nof any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable \n\njudgment that such Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub agents.  \n\n \nSection 8.03.

Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the \n\nBorrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not \n\ntaken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

Each Lender expressly acknowledges that no \n\nAgent nor any of its Related Parties has made any  \n\n    \n\n91 \n\n  \n    \n\nrepresentations or warranties to it and that no act by such Agent hereinafter taken, including, without limitation, any \n\nreview of the affairs of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or \n\nwarranty by such Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to each Agent that it has, independently and without \n\nreliance upon such Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed \n\nappropriate, made its own appraisal of an investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other \n\ncondition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties and made its own decision to make its \n\nLoans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without \n\nreliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem \n\nappropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action \n\nunder this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform \n\nitself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and \n\nthe other Loan Parties. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the \n\nLenders by the applicable Agent hereunder or under any other applicable Loan Document, such Agent shall not have \n\nany duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, \n\noperations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any other \n\nLoan Party which may come into the possession of such Agent or any of its Related Parties.  \n\n \nSection 8.07.

The Lenders will hold harmless and indemnify each Agent in its capacity \n\nas such and each of their respective Affiliates and each of their and their respective Affiliates’ respective officers, \n\ndirectors, employees, managers, managing members, agents, advisors, attorneys and representatives (to the extent not \n\nreimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to the \n\nrespective Loans made by such Lender outstanding on the date on which indemnification is sought, from and against \n\nany and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or \n\ndisbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the \n\npayment of the Loans and including, without limitation, attorneys fees and expenses) be imposed on, incurred by or \n\nasserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, the Loans, the Facility, this \n\nAgreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or \n\nthe transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection \n\nwith any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such Agent’s \n\nliabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting \n\nsolely from such Agent’s gross negligence or willful  \n\n    \n\n92 \n\n  \n    \n\nmisconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment). The agreements \n\nin this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.  \n\n \nSection 8.08.    Agents in Their Individual Capacities.   (a) Each Agent shall have the same rights and powers \n\nunder the Loan Documents, to the extent it is a Lender, as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it \n\nwere not the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” \n\nshall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include such Agent hereunder in \n\nits individual capacity. Each Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from, act as trustee under \n\nindentures of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of \n\n\n\nbusiness with the Borrower, any of its respective Subsidiaries, other Affiliates or any person that may do business \n\nwith or own securities of the Loan Parties or any such Subsidiary or Affiliate, as if such person were not the \n\nAdministrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and \n\nsuch Agent and its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from the Loan Parties and its Affiliates for \n\nservices in connection with the Loan Documents or otherwise, in all cases without any duty to account for the same \n\nto the Lenders.  \n\n \n(b)          Each Lender understands that the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, acting in their \n\nrespective individual capacities, and their respective Affiliates (collectively, an “Agent’s Group”) are engaged in a \n\nwide range of financial services and businesses (including investment management, financing, securities trading, \n\ncorporate and investment banking and research) (such services and businesses are collectively referred to in \n\nthis Section 8.08(b) as “Activities”) and may engage in the Activities with or on behalf of one or more of the Loan \n\nParties or their respective Affiliates. Furthermore, an Agent’s Group may, in undertaking the Activities, engage in \n\ntrading in financial products or undertake other investment businesses for its own account or on behalf of others \n\n(including the Borrower and its Affiliates and including holding, for its own account or on behalf of others, equity, \n\ndebt and similar positions in the Borrower or its Affiliates), including trading in or holding long, short or derivative \n\npositions in securities, loans or other financial products of the Borrower or its Affiliates. Each Lender understands and \n\nagrees that in engaging in the Activities, an Agent’s Group may receive or otherwise obtain information concerning \n\nthe Borrower or its Affiliates (including information concerning the ability of the Borrower to perform its Obligations \n\nhereunder and under the other Loan Documents) which information may not be available to any of the Lenders that \n\nare not members of such Agent’s Group. No Agent nor any member of any Agent’s Group shall have any duty to \n\ndisclose to any Lender or use on behalf of the Lenders, and shall not be liable for the failure to so disclose or use, any \n\ninformation whatsoever about or derived from the Activities or otherwise (including any information concerning  \n\n    \n\n93 \n\n  \n    \n\nthe business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any \n\nAffiliate of the Borrower) or to account for any revenue or profits obtained in connection with the Activities, except \n\nthat each Agent shall deliver or otherwise make available to each Lender such documents as are expressly required by \n\nany Loan Document to be transmitted by such Agent to the Lender.  \n\n \n(c)          Each Lender further understands that there may be situations where members of an Agent’s Group \n\nor their respective customers (including the Borrower and its Affiliates) either now have or may in the future have \n\ninterests or take actions that may conflict with the interests of any one or more of the Lenders (including the interests \n\nof the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents). Each Lender agrees that no member of any Agent’s \n\nGroup is or shall be required to restrict its activities as a result of the Person serving as Administrative Agent and/or \n\nthe Collateral Agent, as applicable, being a member of an Agent’s Group, and that each member of an Agent’s Group \n\nmay undertake any Activities without further consultation with or notification to any Lender.  \n\n \nSection 8.09.    Successor Agent.   Each Agent may resign as Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral \n\nAgent, as applicable, upon 30 days’ written notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. If any Agent shall resign as an \n\nAgent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, then the Majority Lenders shall \n\nappoint a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of such \n\nAgent hereunder; provided that so long as a Default or Event of Default has not occurred and is continuing, the prior \n\nconsent of the Borrower shall be required prior to the appointment of such successor agent; and provided further that \n\nsuch consent from the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Effective upon such appointment and \n\napproval, the term “Administrative Agent” and/or “Collateral Agent,” as applicable, shall mean such successor \n\nagent, and, effective upon the earlier of such appointment and the expiration of such 30 days’ notice, the former \n\nAgent’s rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be terminated, \n\nin either case, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to  this \n\nAgreement or any holders of the Loans. After any retiring Agent’s resignation in such capacity, the provisions of \n\nthis Article 8 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative \n\nAgent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a \n\nparty. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective upon the expiry of the \n\n\n\n30 days’ notice, provided that the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, for purposes of any right of pledge \n\ngoverned by the laws of the Netherlands, including the Dutch CV Pledge, any resignation by the Collateral Agent \n\nshall not be effective with respect to its rights and obligations under the Parallel Debt(s), until such rights and \n\nobligations have been assumed by the successor Collateral Agent. Without  \n\n    \n\n94 \n\n  \n    \n\nprejudice to the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the Collateral Agent will reasonably \n\ncooperate in the assumption of its rights and obligations under or in connection with the Parallel Debt(s) by any such \n\nsuccessor and will reasonably cooperate in transferring to such successor Collateral Agent all rights under the Foreign \n\nPledge Agreement to the extent governed by the laws of the Netherlands.  \n\n \nSection"," 9   \n\nMiscellaneous   \n\n    \n\n":" 9.02 Notice Information for the Borrower and Administrative Agent \n\n \nEXHIBITS:  \n\n \nExhibit A Form of Note \n\nExhibit B Form of Notice of Borrowing \n\nExhibit C Form of Assignment and Acceptance \n\nExhibit D Form of Security Agreement \n\nExhibit E Form of Foreign Pledge Agreement \n\nExhibit F Form of Compliance Certificate \n\nExhibit G Form of Warrant \n\nExhibit H-1 Form of U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate \n\n \nIv \n\n  \n\n \nExhibit H-2 Form of U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate \n\nExhibit H-3 Form of U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate \n\nExhibit H-4 Form of U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate \n\n\n\n \nV \n\n  \n   \nCREDIT AGREEMENT, dated as of June 30, 2014 (this “Agreement”), among RETROPHIN, INC., a \n\nDelaware corporation (the “Borrower”), the Lenders from time to time parties hereto (the “Lenders”) and U.S. \n\nBANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as administrative agent for the Lenders from time to time parties hereto (in \n\nsuch capacity and together with any successor appointed pursuant to Article 8, the “Administrative Agent”).  \n\n \nRECITALS  \n\n \nWHEREAS, as of March 27, 2014, the Borrower completed its acquisition of Manchester Pharmaceuticals \n\nLLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Manchester”) and in connection therewith, issued to the seller a \n\n$33,000,000 senior note (the “Manchester Seller Financing”) and granted the sellers thereof a security interest in \n\nthe equity interests of, and substantially all of the assets of, Manchester (the “Manchester Seller Liens”);  \n\n \nWHEREAS, the Borrower, through its Subsidiaries (including Manchester), intends to conduct the \n\ndevelopment, acquisition and commercialization of therapies for the treatment of serious, catastrophic or rare diseases \n\nin connection with its biopharmaceutical business (the “Company Business”);  \n\n \nWHEREAS, the Borrower has requested that the Lenders agree to make loans in accordance with the terms \n\nand provisions set forth herein in order that the proceeds thereof may be used by the Borrower (x) in order to (i) repay \n\nin full the Manchester Seller Financing and (ii) pay costs and expenses relating to the Transactions and (y) for other \n\ncorporate purposes consistent with the terms hereof;  \n\n \nWHEREAS, each Lender has agreed to make loans on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement; \n\nand  \n\n \nWHEREAS, to induce the Lenders to provide the loans, the Borrower is, among other things, entering into \n\nthis Agreement.  \n\n \nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and agreements herein \n\ncontained, the parties hereto agree as follows:  \n\n \nARTICLE 1  \n\nDEFINITIONS  \n\n \nSection 1.01.

The Borrower irrevocably authorizes each Lender to make or cause to be \n\nmade an appropriate notation on the Schedule attached to such Lender’s Note of the making of Loans or the receipt \n\nof payments, but the failure to record, or any error in so recording, any amount of such Loans or payments on such \n\nSchedule shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under any Notes delivered to \n\nsuch Lender to make payments of principal of or interest on the Loans or on such Notes when due.  \n\n \nSection 2.05.   Prepayments.  (a) Optional.  The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to \n\ntime after the Closing Date to prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, upon at least one Business Day’s prior written \n\nnotice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written notice) to the Administrative Agent before 11:00 a.m., New \n\nYork City time; provided, however, that each partial prepayment shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of \n\n$1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000.

The Borrower shall prepay the Loans in accordance with the following:  \n\n \n(i)         If any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries Disposes of any Property (including any \n\nsale or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any of its Capital Stock (other than \n\nDisqualified Capital Stock and any sales or issuances of Capital Stock to another Loan Party))  \n\n    \n\n35 \n\n  \n\n \n(other than any Disposition of any inventory permitted by Section 6.06(a)) which results in the realization by \n\nsuch Person of Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate during the term of this Agreement, \n\nthe Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds \n\nno later than two Business Days following receipt thereof by such Person (such prepayments to be applied \n\nas set forth in clause (iv) below); provided, however, that with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds, at the \n\nelection of the Borrower (as notified by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of \n\nreceipt of such Net Cash Proceeds), and so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and \n\nbe continuing, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary may apply such Net Cash Proceeds to reinvest in the \n\npurchase of capital assets useful in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary, in each case to be \n\nused in the business of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary within 180 days following the date of receipt of \n\nsuch Net Cash Proceeds (or, if within such 180-day period, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary enters into a \n\nbinding commitment to so reinvest such Net Cash Proceeds, within 360 days following the date of receipt of \n\nsuch Net Cash Proceeds); provided, further, that if within such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-\n\nday) period after the date of receipt by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary of such Net Cash Proceeds, such \n\n\n\nLoan Party or such Subsidiary has not so used all or a portion of such Net Cash Proceeds otherwise required \n\nto be applied as a mandatory repayment pursuant to this Section 2.05(b)(i), the remaining portion of such Net \n\nCash Proceeds shall be applied as a mandatory repayment in accordance with the requirements of this Section \n\n2.05(b)(i) on the last day of such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period.  \n\n \n(ii)         Within two Business Days following any Extraordinary Receipt received by or paid to \n\nor for the account of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate during \n\nthe term of this Agreement, and not otherwise included in this Section 2.05(b), the Borrower shall prepay an \n\naggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom by such \n\nLoan Party or such Subsidiary (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clause (iv) below); provided, \n\nhowever, that with respect to such Extraordinary Receipts, at the election of the Borrower (as notified by the \n\nBorrower to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of receipt of such Extraordinary Receipts), and \n\nso long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such Loan Party or such \n\nSubsidiary may apply such Extraordinary Receipts to reinvest in the purchase of assets useful in the business \n\nof such Loan Party or such Subsidiary, in each case to be used in the business of such Loan Party or such \n\nSubsidiary within 180-days following the date of receipt of such Extraordinary  \n\n    \n\n36 \n\n  \n    \n\nReceipts (or, if within such 180-day period, such Loan Party or such Subsidiary enters into a binding \n\ncommitment to so reinvest such Extraordinary Receipts, within 360 days following the date of receipt of such \n\nExtraordinary Receipts); provided, further, that if within such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) \n\nperiod after the date of receipt by such Loan Party or such Subsidiary of such Extraordinary Receipts, such \n\nLoan Party or such Subsidiary has not so used all or a portion of such Extraordinary Receipts otherwise \n\nrequired to be applied as a mandatory repayment pursuant to this sentence, the remaining portion of such \n\nExtraordinary Receipts shall be applied as a mandatory repayment in accordance with the requirements of \n\nthis Section 2.05(b)(ii) on the last day of such 180-day (or, to the extent applicable, 360-day) period.  \n\n \n(iii)         Upon the incurrence or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any \n\nIndebtedness (other than Indebtedness expressly permitted to be incurred or issued pursuant to Section 6.01), \n\nthe Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds \n\nreceived therefrom no later than two Business Days following receipt thereof by such Loan Party or such \n\nSubsidiary (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in clauses (iv) and (v) below).  \n\n \n(iv)         Each prepayment of Loans pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05(b) \n\nshall be shared among the Lenders ratably.  \n\n \n(c)         All prepayments of Loans under this Section 2.05 (and any repricing or amendment that effectively \n\nrefinances any Loans hereunder), shall be made in an amount equal to the sum of (x) 100% of the principal amount of \n\nsuch Loans being prepaid (or repriced or effectively refinanced) plus (y) all accrued and unpaid interest on the amount \n\nof principal of such Loans being prepaid (or repriced or effectively refinanced) to but excluding the date of such \n\nprepayment (or repricing or refinancing) plus (z) the applicable Prepayment Premium. No amounts repaid hereunder \n\nmay be reborrowed.  \n\n \nSection 2.06.  Interest Rates and Payment Dates.  (a) Except as provided in Section 2.06(b), (x) each LIBOR \n\nRate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from and including the date of such LIBOR Rate \n\nLoan to and excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full, at a rate per annum which shall, during \n\neach Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Adjusted LIBOR Rate \n\nfor such Interest Period and (y) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from \n\nand including the date of such Base Rate Loan to and excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full, \n\nat a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate. Accrued interest on each Loan shall \n\nbe payable in arrears in cash on each Interest Payment Date.  \n\n    \n\n37 \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n(b)         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default under Section 7.01(a) or Section \n\n7.01(g), the Borrower shall pay interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Loan owing to each Lender, payable \n\nin arrears on the dates and in the manner referred to in clause (a) above, and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at \n\nall times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Loan pursuant to clause (a) above; \n\nand (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount payable under the Loan \n\nDocuments that is not paid when due, from the date such amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full, \n\npayable in arrears on the date such amount shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times \n\nto 2% per annum above the rate per annum that would be required to be paid at such time in respect of such amounts.  \n\n \nSection 2.07.

(a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under \n\nthe Notes, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 2:00 p.m. on the day when due in U.S. \n\nDollars to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Account, in same day funds, with payments being \n\nreceived by the Administrative Agent after such time being deemed to have been received on the next succeeding \n\nBusiness Day. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the \n\npayment of principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08) to the Lenders \n\nfor the account of their respective Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable \n\nto any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the \n\nterms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information \n\ncontained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.06(d), from and after the effective date of such Assignment and \n\nAcceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes in respect of the interest \n\nassigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make \n\nall appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.  \n\n \n(b)         All computations of interest and of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a \n\nyear of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) \n\noccurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent \n\nof an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  \n\n \n(c)         Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a \n\nBusiness Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in \n\nsuch case be included in the computation of payment of interest.  \n\n    \n\n38 \n\n  \n    \n\n(d)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on \n\nwhich any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the \n\nAdministrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on \n\nsuch date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such \n\nLender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower \n\nshall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the \n\nAdministrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for \n\neach day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to \n\nthe Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.  \n\n \n(e)         The Loan Parties’ obligation to pay all amounts due hereunder and under any other Loan Documents \n\nshall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including:  \n\n \n(i)         any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, deduction, abatement, suspension, diminution, \n\nreduction, defense or other right which any Loan Party may have against any supplier, whether such supplier \n\nwas paid from the proceeds of Loans or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever arising under or pursuant to \n\nany supply agreement or otherwise relating to the purchase of goods, other property or services from or by \n\nany such supplier;  \n\n\n\n \n(ii)         any defect in the condition, design, operation, or fitness for use of, or any damage to \n\nor loss or destruction of, any equipment or material provided by any such supplier;  \n\n \n(iii)         any actual or alleged default by any such supplier or any other Person under any \n\nsupply agreement; or  \n\n \n(iv)         any other fact or circumstance relating to any supply agreement.  \n\n \nSection 2.08. Taxes. (a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any \n\nobligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or \n\nwithholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings \n\nor other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, \n\nadditions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be \n\nrequired by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case \n\nmay be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender  \n\n    \n\n39 \n\n  \n    \n\nor the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party \n\nshall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made \n\nall required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable \n\nunder this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the \n\nsum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all \n\nsuch deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant \n\nGovernmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  \n\n \n(b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or \n\nfuture stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or \n\nfrom the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a \n\nsecurity interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).  \n\n \n(c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them \n\nharmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent \n\n(as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such \n\nIndemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This \n\nindemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may \n\nbe) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the \n\nBorrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or \n\non behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  \n\n \nEach Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for \n\n(i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already \n\nindemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure \n\nto comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) \n\nany Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in \n\nconnection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not \n\nsuch Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from \n\nthe Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent \n\nmanifest error.  \n\n    \n\n40 \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n(d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the \n\nAdministrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such \n\nother evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.  \n\n \n(e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding \n\nTax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative \n\nAgent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly \n\ncompleted and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will \n\npermit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if \n\nreasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed \n\nby applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower \n\nor the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information \n\nreporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, \n\nexecution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), \n\n(ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or \n\nsubmission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice \n\nthe legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender \n\nthat is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such \n\nLender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the \n\nBorrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt \n\nfrom U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, \n\ndeliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) \n\non or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is \n\napplicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States \n\nis a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-\n\n8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the \n\n“interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, \n\nIRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\npursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)  \n\n    \n\n41 \n\n  \n\n \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption \n\nfor portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the \n\neffect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent \n\nshareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign \n\ncorporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed \n\noriginals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a \n\nU.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other \n\ncertification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership \n\nand one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such \n\nForeign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of \n\neach such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver \n\nto the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or \n\nprior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other \n\nform prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding \n\nTax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to \n\npermit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and \n\n(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\n\n\nimposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA \n\n(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the \n\nBorrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably \n\nrequested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including \n\nas prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by \n\nthe Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to \n\ncomply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s \n\nobligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes \n\nof this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each \n\nLender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any \n\nrespect, it shall update  \n\n    \n\n42 \n\n  \n    \n\nsuch form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability \n\nto do so.  \n\n \nSection 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to \n\nany Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender \n\nshall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to \n\nassign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such \n\nLender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the \n\nfuture, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be \n\ndisadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in \n\nconnection with any such designation or assignment.  \n\n \nSection 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether \n\nvoluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it \n\n(other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the \n\nLoans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in \n\nthe Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably \n\nwith each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such \n\npurchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing \n\nLender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share \n\n(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered \n\nfrom the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of \n\nthe total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender \n\npursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including \n\nthe right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower \n\nor a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.  \n\n \nSection 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an \n\ninducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders \n\nits warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to \n\nadjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to \n\nbe substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, \n\nor delivered in substitution or exchange for  \n\n \n43 \n\n  \n    \n\nany thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to \n\nthe contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable \n\n(subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of \n\n\n\nthe Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each \n\ncase immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  \n\n \n(b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower \n\nwill issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each \n\nWarrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the \n\nClosing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder \n\na Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants \n\nto be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased \n\nby such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such \n\nWarrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such \n\nnotice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants \n\ndeliverable to such Warrantholder).  \n\n \n(c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-\n\n2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal \n\namount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue \n\nprice allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue \n\nprice and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated \n\nhereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent \n\njurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.  \n\n \nSection 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any \n\nGovernmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority \n\nof such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice \n\nthereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or \n\ncontinue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such  \n\n \n44 \n\n  \n\n \nLender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such \n\nLender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid \n\nsuch illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the \n\nBase Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain \n\nsuch LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such \n\nLIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates \n\nbased upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base \n\nRate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative \n\nAgent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the \n\namount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.  \n\n \nSection 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a \n\ncontinuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks \n\nin the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and \n\nreasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the \n\naffected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR \n\nRate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation \n\nof the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such \n\n\n\nnotice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).  \n\n \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in \n\nclause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with \n\nrespect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the \n\nImpacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected \n\nLenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and \n\nfairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has \n\nmade it unlawful, or that  \n\n \n45 \n\n  \n\n \nany Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine \n\nor charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the \n\nauthority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written \n\nnotice thereof.  \n\n \nSection 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change \n\nin Law shall:  \n\n \n(i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance \n\ncharge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or \n\nparticipated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;  \n\n \n(ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified \n\nTaxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection \n\nIncome Taxes); or  \n\n \n(iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense \n\naffecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or \n\nparticipation therein;  \n\n \nand the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing \n\nor maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case \n\nof clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such \n\nLender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, \n\ninterest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional \n\namount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  \n\n \n(b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or \n\nany Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity \n\nrequirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of \n\nsuch Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the \n\nLoans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have \n\nachieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such \n\nLender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such \n\nLender  \n\n \n46 \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\nsuch additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such \n\nreduction suffered.  \n\n \n(c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts \n\nnecessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) \n\nof this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such \n\nLender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.  \n\n \n(d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to \n\nthe foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such \n\ncompensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing \n\nprovisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the \n\ndate that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and \n\nof such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such \n\nincreased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include \n\nthe period of retroactive effect thereof).  \n\n \nSection 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative \n\nAgent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless \n\nfrom any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:  \n\n \n(a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of \n\nthe Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);  \n\n \n(b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to \n\nprepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or  \n\n \n(c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of \n\na request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;  \n\n \nexcluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment \n\nof funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds \n\nwere obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender \n\nin connection with the foregoing.  \n\n   \n\n47 \n\n  \n\n \nFor purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender \n\nshall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other \n\nborrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether \n\nor not such Loan was in fact so funded.  \n\n \nSection 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the \n\nBorrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental \n\nAuthority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, and in each case, such Lender has declined or is \n\nunable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.09, the Borrower may replace such Lender \n\nin accordance with Section 9.13.  \n\n \nSection 2.17.   Survival.   Each party’s obligations under Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 \n\nshall survive termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Loan Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan \n\nDocuments, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.  \n\n \n\n\n\nArticle 3 \n\nRepresentations and Warranties  \n\n \nRepresentations and Warranties of the Borrower. In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent \n\nto enter into this Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make the Loans hereunder, the Borrower makes the following \n\nrepresentations and warranties as to itself and its Subsidiaries:  \n\n \nSection 3.01.   Existence and Power.   The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited \n\nliability company or limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its \n\njurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to do business in each additional jurisdiction necessary or advisable \n\nfor the conduct of its business, except for such failures to so qualify in such additional jurisdictions as would not, \n\nindividually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and each of \n\nits Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to own its Properties and to carry on its business as now being \n\nconducted and as proposed to be conducted. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational \n\npower to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants \n\nand the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower has all requisite organizational power to borrow \n\nthe Loans and issue the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Lenders and Warrantholders in accordance with \n\nthe terms hereof and thereof.  \n\n \n48 \n\n  \n    \n\nSection 3.02.    Authority.   The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower and each of its \n\nSubsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the \n\nBorrower’s issuance of the Notes to the Lenders and the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Warrantholders \n\nin accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, are within such Person’s organizational powers and have been duly \n\nauthorized by all necessary organizational action on the part of such Person’s board of directors (or comparable body) \n\nand, if necessary such Person’s shareholders, members or partners, as the case may be.  \n\n \nSection 3.03.    Binding Effect.   Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan \n\nDocuments has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto and each \n\nof the Notes and Warrants issued has been validly issued in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. Each of this \n\nAgreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the \n\nBorrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto enforceable against such Person in accordance with its respective \n\nterms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, \n\nor other laws relative to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally in effect from time to time and by \n\ngeneral principles of equity whether applied in equity or at law.  \n\n \nSection 3.04.    Capital Stock; Subsidiaries.   (a) As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the \n\nTransactions, the authorized and issued shares of each class of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its \n\nSubsidiaries will be as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a). As of the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, \n\nall of the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be validly \n\nissued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to any pre-emptive rights and owned of record and beneficially \n\nby the Persons listed on Schedule 3.04(a) free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.  \n\n \n(b)          As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, except as set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.04(a), neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of Capital Stock of, or have any \n\ndirect or indirect equity interest in, any other Person.  \n\n \n(c)           Except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(c), as of the Closing Date and after giving effect to the \n\nTransactions, there are no securities outstanding that are convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of Capital \n\nStock of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, nor are there outstanding any rights to subscribe for or purchase, or \n\nany options or warrants for the purchase of, or any agreements (contingent or otherwise) providing for the issuance \n\nof, or any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to, any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower  \n\n\n\n    \n\n49 \n\n  \n    \n\nor any of its Subsidiaries or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares.  \n\n \n(d)          On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of the Borrower or any of its \n\nSubsidiaries shall be subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase, acquire or retire (i) any of its \n\nCapital Stock, (ii) any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any of its Capital Stock, or (iii) any options, \n\nwarrants or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire any of its Capital Stock.  \n\n \nSection 3.05.   Business Operations and Other Information;   Financial Condition; No Material Adverse \n\nEffect. (a) The Borrower has heretofore delivered or caused to be delivered to each Lender copies of the Audited \n\nFinancial Statements (the “Financial Statements”). The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with \n\nGAAP (except as otherwise noted therein), consistently applied, and subject, in the case of each of the Financial \n\nStatements that are unaudited, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes, and \n\npresent fairly in all material respects the Consolidated financial position and related Consolidated income, \n\nstockholders’ equity and cash flows (as applicable) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at each of the dates and for \n\neach of the periods respectively covered thereby.  \n\n \n(b)          As of December 31, 2013, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries had any Indebtedness or \n\nliability, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or any Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities, \n\nliabilities for material taxes, long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, except as reflected or \n\nreserved against on the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements or described in the notes thereto.  \n\n \n(c)          Attached as Schedule 3.05(c) is a copy of the latest (as of the Closing Date) projections of the \n\nconsolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flow of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (assuming \n\nconsummation of the Transactions) for each of the fiscal years of the Borrower in the period from the Closing Date \n\nthrough 2015, including a detailed cash flow forecast for the 12-month period following the Closing Date. Such \n\nprojections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light \n\nof current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future \n\nfinancial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being \n\nacknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may \n\ncause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.  \n\n \n50 \n\n  \n    \n\n(d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of \n\nthe Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of \n\nthe historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been \n\ncompleted immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then \n\nended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial \n\nposition and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of \n\nbusiness on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date \n\nor at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to \n\nfairly reflect such assumptions.  \n\n \n(e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or \n\nwhich could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event \n\nwhich individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a \n\nDefault or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  \n\n \n\n\n\nSection 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.    (a) Except as set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.06, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened \n\nagainst or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties or rights which, if \n\nadversely determined, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse \n\nEffect.  \n\n \n(b)          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened \n\nagainst the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which seek to enjoin, or otherwise prevent the consummation of, the \n\ntransactions contemplated herein or to recover any damages or obtain any relief as a result of any of the transactions \n\ncontemplated herein in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority.  \n\n \n(c)          Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will be after giving effect to the \n\nconsummation of the Transactions, as the case may be, in default under or in violation of any Statute or Order, which \n\ndefault or violation, individually or in the aggregate together with all other such defaults and violations has had, or \n\ncould reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \nSection 3.07.   No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and \n\nits Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, \n\nissuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or  \n\n \n51 \n\n  \n\n \ncompliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the \n\nconsummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or \n\nprovisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to \n\nthe Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the \n\nOrganizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.  \n\n \nSection 3.08.   Consents, Etc.   No consent, approval or authorization of or declaration, registration or filing \n\nwith any Governmental Authority or any nongovernmental Person is required in connection with the execution or \n\ndelivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan \n\nDocuments or the performance by any such Person of its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or as a condition to the \n\nlegality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents, or \n\nthe consummation of any component of the Transactions, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, \n\ndeclarations, registrations or filings as are listed on Schedule 3.08, all of which have been or will on or prior to the \n\nClosing Date be obtained or made and are or will then be in full force and effect, and except those which the failure \n\nto obtain or make could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse \n\nEffect.  \n\n \nSection 3.09.    Outstanding Indebtedness.   Schedule 6.01(a) sets forth a correct and complete list and brief \n\ndescription of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness evidenced by the \n\nLoans) existing on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, in each case showing the aggregate \n\nprincipal amount thereof (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn commitments with respect thereto), the name of \n\nthe respective borrower and any other entity which directly or indirectly guarantees such debt and all Liens securing \n\nsuch Indebtedness.  \n\n \nSection 3.10.   Taxes.  The Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, has timely filed all U.S. federal \n\nand all material state, local and foreign tax returns, information returns and excise tax returns, forms and reports for \n\nTaxes (“Tax Returns”) with the appropriate Governmental Authority which were or are required to have been filed \n\nby or on behalf of any such Persons and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and accurately reflect in \n\n\n\nall material respects all liability for Taxes of the Borrower or Subsidiary taken as a whole for the periods covered \n\nthereby. All Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other material Taxes and assessments payable \n\nby the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof have been timely paid to the appropriate Governmental  \n\n    \n\n52 \n\n  \n    \n\nAuthority, unless such Tax liability is being diligently contested in good faith and the Borrower and/or the appropriate \n\nSubsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, has adequately reserved against such Tax liability on its books and financial \n\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted \n\nwith respect to any such Taxes as of the date hereof. No material Tax assessment against the Borrower, or any \n\nSubsidiary thereof has been proposed, formally or informally. The Tax liabilities of the Borrower and any Subsidiary \n\nthereof are adequately provided for on the relevant Person’s books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP.  \n\n \nSection 3.11.   Disclosure.   None of this Agreement nor any other document or certificate furnished to any \n\nLender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith (including the Financial \n\nStatements), taken in the aggregate, contained, as of its respective date and as of the Closing Date, and no document \n\nor certificate which shall be furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in \n\nconnection herewith, when taken as a whole with, all documents and certificates previously delivered, shall contain, \n\nas of its date of delivery, any untrue statement of a material fact, or as of any such date omitted to state a material fact \n\nnecessary in order to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they \n\nwere made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents \n\nonly that such information was prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it \n\nbeing acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which \n\nmay cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary from the projected results. Neither the \n\nBorrower nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any facts (other than matters of a general economic or political nature) \n\nthat individually or in the aggregate have had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \nSection 3.12.    Margin Regulations.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or intends to \n\nacquire any “margin stock” as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of \n\nthe United States (12 CFR 207). No part of the proceeds of the Loans or the Warrants will be used, and no part of the \n\nproceeds of any loans repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the Loans or the Warrants was used, directly or \n\nindirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board \n\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or \n\ncarrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in \n\na violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation \n\nT of said Board (12 CFR 220). Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries or any agent acting on its behalf has \n\ntaken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or the Loans to violate  \n\n \n53 \n\n  \n\n \nRegulation U, Regulation X, Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n\nSystem of the United States or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter \n\nbe in effect. As used in this Section 3.12, the term “purpose of buying or carrying” has the meaning assigned thereto \n\nin the aforesaid Regulation U.  \n\n \nSection 3.13.   Pension and Benefit Plans.   (a) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material \n\nAdverse Effect, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, each of the Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates is in \n\ncompliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published interpretations \n\nthereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other \n\nsuch ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no Unfunded \n\nPension Liability with respect to any Plans that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \n\n\n\n(b)          Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign \n\nPension Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all requirements of law applicable thereto and the respective \n\nrequirements of the governing documents for such plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material \n\nAdverse Effect, With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, none of the Borrower, any Subsidiaries or any of their \n\nrespective directors, officers, employees or agents has engaged in a transaction which would subject the Borrower or \n\nany Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to a tax or civil penalty. With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, reserves \n\nhave been established in the financial statements furnished to Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities in \n\naccordance with applicable law and prudent business practice or, where required, in accordance with ordinary \n\naccounting practices in the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Pension Plan is maintained. The aggregate unfunded \n\nliabilities with respect to Foreign Pension Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect \n\nassuming proper funding and administration of such foreign Pension Plans on an ongoing basis.  \n\n \nSection 3.14.     Labor Matters.

Appointment. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints (x) U.S. Bank as the \n\nadministrative agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Administrative \n\nAgent is a party and (y) U.S. Bank as the collateral agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan \n\nDocuments to which the Collateral Agent is a party, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes each Agent to \n\nexecute and deliver each other Loan Document on behalf of such Lender and to take such action on behalf of such \n\nLender under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Agent is a party and to \n\nexercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent and/or the \n\nCollateral Agent, as applicable, by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the \n\nAdministrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, is a party, together with such other actions and powers \n\nas are reasonably incidental thereto.

It is understood \n\nand agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with \n\nreference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under \n\nagency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to \n\ncreate or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. Each Lender hereby irrevocably \n\nauthorizes the Collateral Agent to execute and deliver any documents necessary or appropriate (as determined by the \n\n\n\nLenders) to create rights of pledge governed by the laws of the Netherlands for the benefit of the Lenders and the \n\nAgents including, without limitation, a pledge on 65% of the outstanding voting Capital Stock of RTRX International \n\nC.V. pursuant to a Dutch-law governed Foreign Pledge Agreement among certain Subsidiaries of the Borrower and \n\nthe Collateral Agent (the “Dutch CV Pledge”). Without prejudice to the provisions of this  \n\n \n88 \n\n  \n    \n\nAgreement and the other Loan Documents, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree with the creation of a parallel \n\ndebt obligation of the Pledgors as will be described in the Parallel Debt(s) (both as defined in the Dutch CV Pledge) \n\nincluding that any payment received by the Collateral Agent in respect of the Parallel Debt(s) will be deemed a \n\nsatisfaction of a pro rata portion of the corresponding amounts of the Loan Obligations. The provisions of this Article \n\nare solely for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have \n\nrights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions.  \n\n \nSection 8.02.   Delegation of Duties.  Each Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights \n\nand powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub agents appointed by \n\nsuch Agent, and shall be entitled to the advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Each Agent \n\nand any such sub agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their \n\nrespective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub agent and to the \n\nRelated Parties of each Agent and any such sub agent. No Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct \n\nof any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable \n\njudgment that such Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub agents.  \n\n \nSection 8.03.    Exculpatory Provisions.  \n\n \n(a)          The Agents shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in \n\nthe other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature.

No Agent shall be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty \n\nregarding the existence, ownership, transferability, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or \n\nperfection of the Collateral Agent’s Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection \n\ntherewith, nor shall any Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion \n\nof the Collateral. No Agent shall have any liability to the Borrower, any other Loan Party, any Lender or any other \n\nPerson for the Borrower’s, any other Loan Party’s or any Lender’s, as the case may be, performance of, or failure to \n\nperform, any of their respective obligations and duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. It is \n\nexpressly acknowledged and agreed that no Agent is guaranteeing performance of or assuming liability for the \n\nobligations of the other parties to the Loan Documents or to the Collateral. No Agent shall be liable for (a) any indirect, \n\nspecial, punitive or consequential damages (including without limitation lost profits) whatsoever, even if it has been \n\ninformed of the likelihood thereof and regardless of the form of  \n\n    \n\n90 \n\n  \n    \n\naction or (b) any losses or delays arising from (i) any causes or acts beyond its control, (ii) any delay, error, omission \n\nor default of any mail, telegraph, cable or wireless agency or operator or (iii) the acts or edicts of any government or \n\ngovernmental agency or other group or entity exercising governmental powers.  \n\n \nSection 8.04.

Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in \n\nrelying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype \n\nmessage, statement, order or other document or conversation (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet \n\nwebsite posting or other distribution) reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent \n\nor made by the proper Person or Persons. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the \n\nBorrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not \n\ntaken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. Each Agent may deem and treat \n\nthe payee of any Note delivered hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, \n\nnegotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with such Agent. Each Agent shall be fully justified in failing or \n\nrefusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice \n\nor concurrence of the Majority Lenders and it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any \n\nand all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. \n\nNothing contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall require any Agent to advance or expend its \n\nown funds.

Each applicable Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of \n\nDefault as shall be reasonably directed by the Majority Lenders; provided that, unless and until such Agent shall have \n\nreceived such directions, such Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such \n\naction, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.  \n\n \nSection 8.06.     Non Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders.   Each Lender expressly acknowledges that no \n\nAgent nor any of its Related Parties has made any  \n\n    \n\n91 \n\n  \n    \n\nrepresentations or warranties to it and that no act by such Agent hereinafter taken, including, without limitation, any \n\nreview of the affairs of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or \n\nwarranty by such Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to each Agent that it has, independently and without \n\nreliance upon such Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed \n\nappropriate, made its own appraisal of an investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other \n\ncondition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties and made its own decision to make its \n\nLoans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without \n\nreliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem \n\nappropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action \n\nunder this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform \n\nitself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and \n\nthe other Loan Parties. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the \n\nLenders by the applicable Agent hereunder or under any other applicable Loan Document, such Agent shall not have \n\nany duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, \n\noperations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any other \n\nLoan Party which may come into the possession of such Agent or any of its Related Parties.  \n\n \nSection 8.07.

The Lenders will hold harmless and indemnify each Agent in its capacity \n\nas such and each of their respective Affiliates and each of their and their respective Affiliates’ respective officers, \n\ndirectors, employees, managers, managing members, agents, advisors, attorneys and representatives (to the extent not \n\nreimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to the \n\nrespective Loans made by such Lender outstanding on the date on which indemnification is sought, from and against \n\nany and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or \n\ndisbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the \n\npayment of the Loans and including, without limitation, attorneys fees and expenses) be imposed on, incurred by or \n\nasserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, the Loans, the Facility, this \n\nAgreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or \n\nthe transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection \n\nwith any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such Agent’s \n\nliabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting \n\nsolely from such Agent’s gross negligence or willful  \n\n    \n\n92 \n\n  \n    \n\nmisconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment). The agreements \n\nin this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.  \n\n \nSection 8.08.    Agents in Their Individual Capacities.   (a) Each Agent shall have the same rights and powers \n\nunder the Loan Documents, to the extent it is a Lender, as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it \n\nwere not the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” \n\nshall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include such Agent hereunder in \n\nits individual capacity. Each Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from, act as trustee under \n\nindentures of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of \n\n\n\nbusiness with the Borrower, any of its respective Subsidiaries, other Affiliates or any person that may do business \n\nwith or own securities of the Loan Parties or any such Subsidiary or Affiliate, as if such person were not the \n\nAdministrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and \n\nsuch Agent and its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from the Loan Parties and its Affiliates for \n\nservices in connection with the Loan Documents or otherwise, in all cases without any duty to account for the same \n\nto the Lenders.  \n\n \n(b)          Each Lender understands that the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, acting in their \n\nrespective individual capacities, and their respective Affiliates (collectively, an “Agent’s Group”) are engaged in a \n\nwide range of financial services and businesses (including investment management, financing, securities trading, \n\ncorporate and investment banking and research) (such services and businesses are collectively referred to in \n\nthis Section 8.08(b) as “Activities”) and may engage in the Activities with or on behalf of one or more of the Loan \n\nParties or their respective Affiliates. Furthermore, an Agent’s Group may, in undertaking the Activities, engage in \n\ntrading in financial products or undertake other investment businesses for its own account or on behalf of others \n\n(including the Borrower and its Affiliates and including holding, for its own account or on behalf of others, equity, \n\ndebt and similar positions in the Borrower or its Affiliates), including trading in or holding long, short or derivative \n\npositions in securities, loans or other financial products of the Borrower or its Affiliates. Each Lender understands and \n\nagrees that in engaging in the Activities, an Agent’s Group may receive or otherwise obtain information concerning \n\nthe Borrower or its Affiliates (including information concerning the ability of the Borrower to perform its Obligations \n\nhereunder and under the other Loan Documents) which information may not be available to any of the Lenders that \n\nare not members of such Agent’s Group. No Agent nor any member of any Agent’s Group shall have any duty to \n\ndisclose to any Lender or use on behalf of the Lenders, and shall not be liable for the failure to so disclose or use, any \n\ninformation whatsoever about or derived from the Activities or otherwise (including any information concerning  \n\n    \n\n93 \n\n  \n    \n\nthe business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any \n\nAffiliate of the Borrower) or to account for any revenue or profits obtained in connection with the Activities, except \n\nthat each Agent shall deliver or otherwise make available to each Lender such documents as are expressly required by \n\nany Loan Document to be transmitted by such Agent to the Lender.  \n\n \n(c)          Each Lender further understands that there may be situations where members of an Agent’s Group \n\nor their respective customers (including the Borrower and its Affiliates) either now have or may in the future have \n\ninterests or take actions that may conflict with the interests of any one or more of the Lenders (including the interests \n\nof the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents). Each Lender agrees that no member of any Agent’s \n\nGroup is or shall be required to restrict its activities as a result of the Person serving as Administrative Agent and/or \n\nthe Collateral Agent, as applicable, being a member of an Agent’s Group, and that each member of an Agent’s Group \n\nmay undertake any Activities without further consultation with or notification to any Lender.  \n\n \nSection 8.09.    Successor Agent.   Each Agent may resign as Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral \n\nAgent, as applicable, upon 30 days’ written notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. If any Agent shall resign as an \n\nAgent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, then the Majority Lenders shall \n\nappoint a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of such \n\nAgent hereunder; provided that so long as a Default or Event of Default has not occurred and is continuing, the prior \n\nconsent of the Borrower shall be required prior to the appointment of such successor agent; and provided further that \n\nsuch consent from the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Effective upon such appointment and \n\napproval, the term “Administrative Agent” and/or “Collateral Agent,” as applicable, shall mean such successor \n\nagent, and, effective upon the earlier of such appointment and the expiration of such 30 days’ notice, the former \n\nAgent’s rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be terminated, \n\nin either case, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to  this \n\nAgreement or any holders of the Loans. After any retiring Agent’s resignation in such capacity, the provisions of \n\nthis Article 8 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative \n\nAgent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a \n\nparty. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective upon the expiry of the \n\n\n\n30 days’ notice, provided that the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, for purposes of any right of pledge \n\ngoverned by the laws of the Netherlands, including the Dutch CV Pledge, any resignation by the Collateral Agent \n\nshall not be effective with respect to its rights and obligations under the Parallel Debt(s), until such rights and \n\nobligations have been assumed by the successor Collateral Agent. Without  \n\n    \n\n94 \n\n  \n    \n\nprejudice to the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the Collateral Agent will reasonably \n\ncooperate in the assumption of its rights and obligations under or in connection with the Parallel Debt(s) by any such \n\nsuccessor and will reasonably cooperate in transferring to such successor Collateral Agent all rights under the Foreign \n\nPledge Agreement to the extent governed by the laws of the Netherlands.  \n\n \nSection 8.10.   Lenders as Agent.   Upon written notice to the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral \n\nAgent, as applicable, and the Borrower by the Majority Lenders, any provision of the Loan Documents requiring the \n\nconsent or agreement or other approval or action of the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as \n\napplicable, may instead require the consent, agreement or other approval or action of the Majority Lenders; provided, \n\nhowever, for the avoidance of doubt, any such consent, agreement, approval or action which affects the rights or duties \n\nof the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in its capacity as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent shall \n\nrequire the consent of the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable.  \n\n \nArticle 9  \n\nMISCELLANEOUS  \n\n \nSection"," 9.02.

(a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under \n\nthe Notes, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 2:00 p.m. on the day when due in U.S. \n\nDollars to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Account, in same day funds, with payments being \n\nreceived by the Administrative Agent after such time being deemed to have been received on the next succeeding \n\nBusiness Day. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the \n\npayment of principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08) to the Lenders \n\nfor the account of their respective Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable \n\nto any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the \n\nterms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information \n\ncontained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.06(d), from and after the effective date of such Assignment and \n\nAcceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes in respect of the interest \n\nassigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make \n\nall appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.  \n\n \n(b)         All computations of interest and of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a \n\nyear of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) \n\noccurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent \n\nof an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  \n\n \n(c)         Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a \n\nBusiness Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in \n\nsuch case be included in the computation of payment of interest.  \n\n    \n\n38 \n\n  \n    \n\n(d)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on \n\nwhich any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the \n\nAdministrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on \n\nsuch date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such \n\nLender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower \n\nshall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the \n\nAdministrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for \n\neach day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to \n\nthe Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.  \n\n \n(e)         The Loan Parties’ obligation to pay all amounts due hereunder and under any other Loan Documents \n\nshall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including:  \n\n \n(i)         any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, deduction, abatement, suspension, diminution, \n\nreduction, defense or other right which any Loan Party may have against any supplier, whether such supplier \n\nwas paid from the proceeds of Loans or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever arising under or pursuant to \n\nany supply agreement or otherwise relating to the purchase of goods, other property or services from or by \n\nany such supplier;  \n\n\n\n \n(ii)         any defect in the condition, design, operation, or fitness for use of, or any damage to \n\nor loss or destruction of, any equipment or material provided by any such supplier;  \n\n \n(iii)         any actual or alleged default by any such supplier or any other Person under any \n\nsupply agreement; or  \n\n \n(iv)         any other fact or circumstance relating to any supply agreement.  \n\n \nSection 2.08. Taxes. (a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or on account of any \n\nobligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or \n\nwithholding for any and all present or future taxes, duties, fees, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, withholdings \n\nor other charges (including backup withholding) imposed by any Governmental Authority, including any interest, \n\nadditions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (“Taxes”). If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be \n\nrequired by law (as determined in good faith by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case \n\nmay be) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender  \n\n    \n\n39 \n\n  \n    \n\nor the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party \n\nshall be increased as may be necessary so that after the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent have made \n\nall required deductions or withholding (including deductions or withholding applicable to additional sums payable \n\nunder this Section 2.08) such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the \n\nsum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) the Loan Parties shall make all \n\nsuch deductions or withholding and (iii) the Loan Parties shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant \n\nGovernmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  \n\n \n(b)         In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or \n\nfuture stamp, court or documentary, or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or \n\nfrom the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, performance under, from the receipt or perfection of a \n\nsecurity interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).  \n\n \n(c)         The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold them \n\nharmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent \n\n(as the case may be), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such \n\nIndemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This \n\nindemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may \n\nbe) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the \n\nBorrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or \n\non behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  \n\n \nEach Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for \n\n(i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already \n\nindemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure \n\nto comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(g) relating to the requirement to maintain a Participant Register and (iii) \n\nany Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in \n\nconnection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising in connection therewith, whether or not \n\nsuch Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate from \n\nthe Administrative Agent as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Lender shall be conclusive absent \n\nmanifest error.  \n\n    \n\n40 \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n(d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the applicable Loan Party shall furnish to the \n\nAdministrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt, or such \n\nother evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender.  \n\n \n(e)         Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding \n\nTax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative \n\nAgent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly \n\ncompleted and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will \n\npermit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if \n\nreasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed \n\nby applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower \n\nor the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information \n\nreporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, \n\nexecution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(A), \n\n(ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or \n\nsubmission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice \n\nthe legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Lender \n\nthat is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such \n\nLender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the \n\nBorrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt \n\nfrom U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, \n\ndeliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) \n\non or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is \n\napplicable: (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States \n\nis a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-\n\n8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the \n\n“interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, \n\nIRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\npursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (ii)  \n\n    \n\n41 \n\n  \n\n \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption \n\nfor portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the \n\neffect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent \n\nshareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign \n\ncorporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed \n\noriginals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, \n\nexecuted originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a \n\nU.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other \n\ncertification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership \n\nand one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such \n\nForeign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of \n\neach such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver \n\nto the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or \n\nprior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time \n\nthereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other \n\nform prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding \n\nTax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to \n\npermit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and \n\n(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax \n\n\n\nimposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA \n\n(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the \n\nBorrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably \n\nrequested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including \n\nas prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by \n\nthe Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to \n\ncomply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s \n\nobligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes \n\nof this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each \n\nLender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any \n\nrespect, it shall update  \n\n    \n\n42 \n\n  \n    \n\nsuch form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability \n\nto do so.  \n\n \nSection 2.09.  Lender’s Obligation to Mitigate.  If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to \n\nany Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08, then such Lender \n\nshall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to \n\nassign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such \n\nLender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 in the \n\nfuture, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be \n\ndisadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in \n\nconnection with any such designation or assignment.  \n\n \nSection 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether \n\nvoluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it \n\n(other than amounts received pursuant to Section 2.08) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the \n\nLoans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in \n\nthe Loans owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably \n\nwith each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such \n\npurchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing \n\nLender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share \n\n(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered \n\nfrom the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of \n\nthe total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender \n\npursuant to this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including \n\nthe right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower \n\nor a Lender, as the case may be, in the amount of such participation.  \n\n \nSection 2.11.   Warrants.  (a) In connection with the borrowing of the Loans by the Borrower and as an \n\ninducement to the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower has agreed to authorize the issuance to the Warrantholders \n\nits warrants, initially exercisable to purchase up to an aggregate of 337,500 shares of its Common Stock (subject to \n\nadjustment and limitations on exercisability as therein provided), at an initial exercise price of $12.7552 per share to \n\nbe substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (all such warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement, \n\nor delivered in substitution or exchange for  \n\n \n43 \n\n  \n    \n\nany thereof, being collectively called the “Warrants” and, individually, a “Warrant”). Notwithstanding anything to \n\nthe contrary set forth herein, the Loans and the Warrants will be immediately separable and separately transferable \n\n(subject in the case of Warrants to the applicable restrictions set forth therein and the Organizational Documents of \n\n\n\nthe Borrower), and, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Warrants shall be immediately exercisable, in each \n\ncase immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  \n\n \n(b)         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the Borrower \n\nwill issue the Warrants to each of the Warrantholders, in aggregate amounts equal, with respect to each \n\nWarrantholders, to the respective amounts set forth on Schedule I hereto opposite such Warrantholder’s name. On the \n\nClosing Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower will deliver to each Warrantholder \n\na Warrant or Warrants registered in such Warrantholder’s name or Warrants in the name of its nominee, such Warrants \n\nto be duly executed and dated the Closing Date, representing the aggregate number of the Warrants to be purchased \n\nby such Warrantholder as shown on Schedule I hereto, such Warrants to be in such denominations as such \n\nWarrantholder may specify by two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower (or, in the absence of such \n\nnotice, one Warrant registered in such Warrantholder’s name representing the aggregate number of warrants \n\ndeliverable to such Warrantholder).  \n\n \n(c)         Allocation of Purchase Price. It is hereby agreed that, for purposes of Treasury Regulations § 1.1273-\n\n2(h), (i) the aggregate “issue price” of the Loans and Warrants on the Closing Date is equal to 99% of the principal \n\namount of the Loans and (ii) the portion of the issue price allocated to the Warrants is 7% and the portion of the issue \n\nprice allocated to the Loans is 93%. Each of the Borrower and the Warrantholders agrees to use the foregoing issue \n\nprice and issue price allocation for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated \n\nhereby (unless otherwise required by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent \n\njurisdiction) and for all other financial accounting purposes.  \n\n \nSection 2.12.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any \n\nGovernmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority \n\nof such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice \n\nthereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or \n\ncontinue Loans shall be suspended. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such  \n\n \n44 \n\n  \n\n \nLender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such \n\nLender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid \n\nsuch illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the \n\nBase Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain \n\nsuch LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such \n\nLIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates \n\nbased upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base \n\nRate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative \n\nAgent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest \n\nrates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the \n\namount so prepaid or converted together with the Prepayment Premium.  \n\n \nSection 2.13. Inability to Determine Rates. If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a \n\ncontinuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks \n\nin the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, or (ii) adequate and \n\nreasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed Loan (with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the \n\naffected Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a \n\nproposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR \n\nRate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation \n\nof the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans or Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the affected Lenders revokes such \n\n\n\nnotice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a continuation of LIBOR Rate \n\nLoans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or Interest Periods).  \n\n \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in \n\nclause (a)(i) of this section, the rate of interest described in clause (b) of the definition of “Base Rate” shall apply with \n\nrespect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the \n\nImpacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the affected \n\nLenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and \n\nfairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has \n\nmade it unlawful, or that  \n\n \n45 \n\n  \n\n \nany Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, \n\nmaintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine \n\nor charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the \n\nauthority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written \n\nnotice thereof.  \n\n \nSection 2.14.   Increased Costs to Such Day; Reserves on Loans. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change \n\nin Law shall:  \n\n \n(i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance \n\ncharge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or \n\nparticipated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Rate;  \n\n \n(ii)      subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified \n\nTaxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection \n\nIncome Taxes); or  \n\n \n(iii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense \n\naffecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or \n\nparticipation therein;  \n\n \nand the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing \n\nor maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (or, in the case \n\nof clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such \n\nLender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, \n\ninterest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional \n\namount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  \n\n \n(b)          Capital Requirements.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or \n\nany Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity \n\nrequirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of \n\nsuch Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the \n\nLoans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have \n\nachieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such \n\nLender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such \n\nLender  \n\n \n46 \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\nsuch additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such \n\nreduction suffered.  \n\n \n(c)          Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts \n\nnecessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) \n\nof this section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such \n\nLender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.  \n\n \n(d)          Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to \n\nthe foregoing provisions of this section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such \n\ncompensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing \n\nprovisions of this section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the \n\ndate that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and \n\nof such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such \n\nincreased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include \n\nthe period of retroactive effect thereof).  \n\n \nSection 2.15.   Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative \n\nAgent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless \n\nfrom any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:  \n\n \n(a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of \n\nthe Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);  \n\n \n(b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to \n\nprepay, borrow or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or  \n\n \n(c)       any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of \n\na request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.13;  \n\n \nexcluding any loss of anticipated profits and including loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment \n\nof funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds \n\nwere obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender \n\nin connection with the foregoing.  \n\n   \n\n47 \n\n  \n\n \nFor purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 2.15, each Lender \n\nshall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other \n\nborrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether \n\nor not such Loan was in fact so funded.  \n\n \nSection 2.16.   Replacement of Lenders.

Existence and Power.   The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited \n\nliability company or limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its \n\njurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to do business in each additional jurisdiction necessary or advisable \n\nfor the conduct of its business, except for such failures to so qualify in such additional jurisdictions as would not, \n\nindividually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and each of \n\nits Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational power to own its Properties and to carry on its business as now being \n\nconducted and as proposed to be conducted. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite organizational \n\npower to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants \n\nand the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Borrower has all requisite organizational power to borrow \n\nthe Loans and issue the Warrants (including the Warrant Stock) to the Lenders and Warrantholders in accordance with \n\nthe terms hereof and thereof.  \n\n \n48 \n\n  \n    \n\nSection 3.02.

Each of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan \n\nDocuments has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto and each \n\nof the Notes and Warrants issued has been validly issued in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. Each of this \n\nAgreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the other Loan Documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the \n\nBorrower and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto enforceable against such Person in accordance with its respective \n\nterms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, \n\nor other laws relative to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally in effect from time to time and by \n\ngeneral principles of equity whether applied in equity or at law.  \n\n \nSection 3.04.

(a) As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the \n\nTransactions, the authorized and issued shares of each class of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its \n\nSubsidiaries will be as set forth on Schedule 3.04(a). As of the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, \n\nall of the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries will be validly \n\nissued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to any pre-emptive rights and owned of record and beneficially \n\nby the Persons listed on Schedule 3.04(a) free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.  \n\n \n(b)          As of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, except as set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.04(a), neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of Capital Stock of, or have any \n\ndirect or indirect equity interest in, any other Person.  \n\n \n(c)           Except as set forth on Schedule 3.04(c), as of the Closing Date and after giving effect to the \n\nTransactions, there are no securities outstanding that are convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of Capital \n\nStock of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, nor are there outstanding any rights to subscribe for or purchase, or \n\nany options or warrants for the purchase of, or any agreements (contingent or otherwise) providing for the issuance \n\nof, or any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to, any shares of Capital Stock of the Borrower  \n\n\n\n    \n\n49 \n\n  \n    \n\nor any of its Subsidiaries or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares.  \n\n \n(d)          On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of the Borrower or any of its \n\nSubsidiaries shall be subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase, acquire or retire (i) any of its \n\nCapital Stock, (ii) any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any of its Capital Stock, or (iii) any options, \n\nwarrants or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire any of its Capital Stock.  \n\n \nSection 3.05.   Business Operations and Other Information;   Financial Condition; No Material Adverse \n\nEffect. (a) The Borrower has heretofore delivered or caused to be delivered to each Lender copies of the Audited \n\nFinancial Statements (the “Financial Statements”). The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with \n\nGAAP (except as otherwise noted therein), consistently applied, and subject, in the case of each of the Financial \n\nStatements that are unaudited, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes, and \n\npresent fairly in all material respects the Consolidated financial position and related Consolidated income, \n\nstockholders’ equity and cash flows (as applicable) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at each of the dates and for \n\neach of the periods respectively covered thereby.  \n\n \n(b)          As of December 31, 2013, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries had any Indebtedness or \n\nliability, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or any Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities, \n\nliabilities for material taxes, long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, except as reflected or \n\nreserved against on the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements or described in the notes thereto.  \n\n \n(c)          Attached as Schedule 3.05(c) is a copy of the latest (as of the Closing Date) projections of the \n\nconsolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flow of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (assuming \n\nconsummation of the Transactions) for each of the fiscal years of the Borrower in the period from the Closing Date \n\nthrough 2015, including a detailed cash flow forecast for the 12-month period following the Closing Date. Such \n\nprojections have been prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of assumptions, set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.05(c), which such management reasonably believes as of the Closing Date are fair and reasonable in light \n\nof current and reasonably foreseeable business conditions, and represent such management’s estimate of the future \n\nfinancial performance (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, it being \n\nacknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may \n\ncause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary materially from the projected results.  \n\n \n50 \n\n  \n    \n\n(d)          Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05(d) are true and complete copies of pro forma balance sheets of \n\nthe Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, prepared by management of the Borrower on the basis of \n\nthe historical unaudited balance sheets of the Borrower as of May 30, 2014, as though the Transactions had been \n\ncompleted immediately prior to such date, together with the related income statements for the 12-month period then \n\nended. Such pro forma balance sheets and income statements each fairly presents in all material respects the financial \n\nposition and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of \n\nbusiness on such date on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been completed immediately prior to such date \n\nor at the beginning of such period, as the case may be, and contains all pro forma adjustments necessary in order to \n\nfairly reflect such assumptions.  \n\n \n(e)          Since December 31, 2013, no development or event that individually or in the aggregate has had, or \n\nwhich could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and no development or event \n\nwhich individually or in the aggregate would have constituted, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, a \n\nDefault or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  \n\n \n\n\n\nSection 3.06.   Litigation; No Violation of Governmental Orders or Laws.    (a) Except as set forth on \n\nSchedule 3.06, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened \n\nagainst or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties or rights which, if \n\nadversely determined, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse \n\nEffect.  \n\n \n(b)          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened \n\nagainst the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which seek to enjoin, or otherwise prevent the consummation of, the \n\ntransactions contemplated herein or to recover any damages or obtain any relief as a result of any of the transactions \n\ncontemplated herein in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority.  \n\n \n(c)          Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will be after giving effect to the \n\nconsummation of the Transactions, as the case may be, in default under or in violation of any Statute or Order, which \n\ndefault or violation, individually or in the aggregate together with all other such defaults and violations has had, or \n\ncould reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \nSection 3.07.   No Conflicts with Agreements, Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and \n\nits Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the offering, \n\nissuance and sale of the Loans and the Warrants by the Borrower, nor the fulfillment of, or  \n\n \n51 \n\n  \n\n \ncompliance by, any Person with the respective terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, nor the \n\nconsummation of the Transactions, will conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or \n\nprovisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens created pursuant to \n\nthe Loan Documents) on any Properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the \n\nOrganizational Documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary is bound or to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary or any of its respective assets are subject or (iii) any Statute or Order to which the Borrower or \n\nany such Subsidiary or any of their respective assets are subject.  \n\n \nSection 3.08.   Consents, Etc.   No consent, approval or authorization of or declaration, registration or filing \n\nwith any Governmental Authority or any nongovernmental Person is required in connection with the execution or \n\ndelivery by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan \n\nDocuments or the performance by any such Person of its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or as a condition to the \n\nlegality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants or any of the other Loan Documents, or \n\nthe consummation of any component of the Transactions, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, \n\ndeclarations, registrations or filings as are listed on Schedule 3.08, all of which have been or will on or prior to the \n\nClosing Date be obtained or made and are or will then be in full force and effect, and except those which the failure \n\nto obtain or make could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse \n\nEffect.  \n\n \nSection 3.09.    Outstanding Indebtedness.   Schedule 6.01(a) sets forth a correct and complete list and brief \n\ndescription of all Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness evidenced by the \n\nLoans) existing on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, in each case showing the aggregate \n\nprincipal amount thereof (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn commitments with respect thereto), the name of \n\nthe respective borrower and any other entity which directly or indirectly guarantees such debt and all Liens securing \n\nsuch Indebtedness.  \n\n \nSection 3.10.   Taxes.  The Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, has timely filed all U.S. federal \n\nand all material state, local and foreign tax returns, information returns and excise tax returns, forms and reports for \n\nTaxes (“Tax Returns”) with the appropriate Governmental Authority which were or are required to have been filed \n\nby or on behalf of any such Persons and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and accurately reflect in \n\n\n\nall material respects all liability for Taxes of the Borrower or Subsidiary taken as a whole for the periods covered \n\nthereby. All Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other material Taxes and assessments payable \n\nby the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof have been timely paid to the appropriate Governmental  \n\n    \n\n52 \n\n  \n    \n\nAuthority, unless such Tax liability is being diligently contested in good faith and the Borrower and/or the appropriate \n\nSubsidiaries thereof, as the case may be, has adequately reserved against such Tax liability on its books and financial \n\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted \n\nwith respect to any such Taxes as of the date hereof. No material Tax assessment against the Borrower, or any \n\nSubsidiary thereof has been proposed, formally or informally. The Tax liabilities of the Borrower and any Subsidiary \n\nthereof are adequately provided for on the relevant Person’s books and financial statements in accordance with GAAP.  \n\n \nSection 3.11.   Disclosure.   None of this Agreement nor any other document or certificate furnished to any \n\nLender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection herewith (including the Financial \n\nStatements), taken in the aggregate, contained, as of its respective date and as of the Closing Date, and no document \n\nor certificate which shall be furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in \n\nconnection herewith, when taken as a whole with, all documents and certificates previously delivered, shall contain, \n\nas of its date of delivery, any untrue statement of a material fact, or as of any such date omitted to state a material fact \n\nnecessary in order to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they \n\nwere made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents \n\nonly that such information was prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it \n\nbeing acknowledged that the projections and their underlying assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which \n\nmay cause the actual results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to vary from the projected results. Neither the \n\nBorrower nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any facts (other than matters of a general economic or political nature) \n\nthat individually or in the aggregate have had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \nSection 3.12.    Margin Regulations.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or intends to \n\nacquire any “margin stock” as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of \n\nthe United States (12 CFR 207). No part of the proceeds of the Loans or the Warrants will be used, and no part of the \n\nproceeds of any loans repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the Loans or the Warrants was used, directly or \n\nindirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board \n\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or \n\ncarrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in \n\na violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation \n\nT of said Board (12 CFR 220). Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries or any agent acting on its behalf has \n\ntaken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or the Loans to violate  \n\n \n53 \n\n  \n\n \nRegulation U, Regulation X, Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n\nSystem of the United States or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter \n\nbe in effect. As used in this Section 3.12, the term “purpose of buying or carrying” has the meaning assigned thereto \n\nin the aforesaid Regulation U.  \n\n \nSection 3.13.   Pension and Benefit Plans.   (a) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material \n\nAdverse Effect, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, each of the Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates is in \n\ncompliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published interpretations \n\nthereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other \n\nsuch ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no Unfunded \n\nPension Liability with respect to any Plans that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  \n\n \n\n\n\n(b)          Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign \n\nPension Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all requirements of law applicable thereto and the respective \n\nrequirements of the governing documents for such plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material \n\nAdverse Effect, With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, none of the Borrower, any Subsidiaries or any of their \n\nrespective directors, officers, employees or agents has engaged in a transaction which would subject the Borrower or \n\nany Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to a tax or civil penalty. With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, reserves \n\nhave been established in the financial statements furnished to Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities in \n\naccordance with applicable law and prudent business practice or, where required, in accordance with ordinary \n\naccounting practices in the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Pension Plan is maintained. The aggregate unfunded \n\nliabilities with respect to Foreign Pension Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect \n\nassuming proper funding and administration of such foreign Pension Plans on an ongoing basis.  \n\n \nSection 3.14.     Labor Matters.   As of the date hereof and the Closing Date, there are no strikes, lockouts or \n\nslowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge the Borrower, threatened. The hours \n\nworked by and payments made to employees of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the \n\nFair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters. All \n\npayments due from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any \n\nSubsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or \n\naccrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions will \n\nnot give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation  \n\n    \n\n54 \n\n  \n\n \non the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.  \n\n \nSection 3.15.

Ranking of Loans.   The Indebtedness represented by the Loans and the other Loan Obligations \n\nunder the applicable Loan Documents of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties is intended to constitute senior \n\nIndebtedness, and accordingly is, and shall be, at all times while the Loans and the other Loan Obligations remain \n\noutstanding senior in right of payment to, or pari passu with, all Indebtedness of the Loan Parties.  \n\n \nSection 3.21.   Solvency.   The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are Solvent on the Closing \n\nDate both before and after giving effect to the Transactions to be effected on the Closing Date and the application of \n\nthe net proceeds of the Loans and the Warrants.  \n\n \nSection 3.22.     Restrictions on or Relating to Subsidiaries.   There does not exist any encumbrance or \n\nrestriction on the ability of (x) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to pay dividends or make any other distributions on its \n\nCapital Stock or any other interest or participation in its profits owned by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, or \n\nto pay any Indebtedness owed to the Borrower or a Subsidiary thereof, (y) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to make \n\nloans or advances to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof or (z) any Subsidiary of the Borrower to transfer any of \n\nits properties or assets to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, except for such encumbrances or restrictions existing \n\nunder or by reason of (i) applicable law, (ii) the Loan Documents with respect to clause (z) only, Liens permitted to \n\nexist pursuant to Section 6.02 and (iii) with respect to clause (z) only, customary restrictions on assignment, subletting \n\nor transfer in any lease, license or contract.

or  \n\n \n(k)          any Change of Control shall occur,  \n\n \nthen, and in any such event, (A) if such event is an Event of Default specified in subsection (g) of Section 7.01 with \n\nrespect to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, the Loans (with accrued interest thereon together with the applicable \n\nPrepayment Premium) and all other amounts owing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall \n\nimmediately become due and payable, or (B) if such event is any other Event of Default, either or both of the following \n\nactions may be taken: the  \n\n    \n\n87 \n\n  \n    \n\nAdministrative Agent shall, upon written request of the Majority Lenders, by notice to the Borrower, declare the Loans \n\n(with accrued interest thereon together with the applicable Prepayment Premium) and all other amounts owing \n\nhereunder to be due and payable forthwith, whereupon the same shall immediately become due and payable. Except \n\nas expressly provided above in this Article 7, presentment, demand, protest and all other notices of any kind are hereby \n\nexpressly waived.  \n\n \nArticle 8  \n\nTHE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND COLLATERAL AGENT  \n\n \nSection 8.01. Appointment. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints (x) U.S. Bank as the \n\nadministrative agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Administrative \n\nAgent is a party and (y) U.S. Bank as the collateral agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan \n\nDocuments to which the Collateral Agent is a party, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes each Agent to \n\nexecute and deliver each other Loan Document on behalf of such Lender and to take such action on behalf of such \n\nLender under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Agent is a party and to \n\nexercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent and/or the \n\nCollateral Agent, as applicable, by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the \n\nAdministrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, is a party, together with such other actions and powers \n\nas are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no \n\nAgent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship \n\nwith any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read \n\ninto this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against each applicable Agent. It is understood \n\nand agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with \n\nreference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under \n\nagency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to \n\ncreate or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. Each Lender hereby irrevocably \n\nauthorizes the Collateral Agent to execute and deliver any documents necessary or appropriate (as determined by the \n\n\n\nLenders) to create rights of pledge governed by the laws of the Netherlands for the benefit of the Lenders and the \n\nAgents including, without limitation, a pledge on 65% of the outstanding voting Capital Stock of RTRX International \n\nC.V. pursuant to a Dutch-law governed Foreign Pledge Agreement among certain Subsidiaries of the Borrower and \n\nthe Collateral Agent (the “Dutch CV Pledge”). Without prejudice to the provisions of this  \n\n \n88 \n\n  \n    \n\nAgreement and the other Loan Documents, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree with the creation of a parallel \n\ndebt obligation of the Pledgors as will be described in the Parallel Debt(s) (both as defined in the Dutch CV Pledge) \n\nincluding that any payment received by the Collateral Agent in respect of the Parallel Debt(s) will be deemed a \n\nsatisfaction of a pro rata portion of the corresponding amounts of the Loan Obligations. The provisions of this Article \n\nare solely for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have \n\nrights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions.  \n\n \nSection 8.02.   Delegation of Duties.  Each Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights \n\nand powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub agents appointed by \n\nsuch Agent, and shall be entitled to the advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Each Agent \n\nand any such sub agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their \n\nrespective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub agent and to the \n\nRelated Parties of each Agent and any such sub agent. No Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct \n\nof any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable \n\njudgment that such Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub agents.  \n\n \nSection 8.03.    Exculpatory Provisions.  \n\n \n(a)          The Agents shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in \n\nthe other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality \n\nof the foregoing, the Agents:  \n\n \n(i)          shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default \n\nhas occurred and is continuing;  \n\n \n(ii)         shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary \n\npowers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan \n\nDocuments that the applicable Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Majority Lenders; \n\nprovided that no Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, \n\nmay expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for \n\nthe avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief \n\nLaw; and  \n\n \n(iii)        shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any \n\nduty to disclose, and shall not be liable  \n\n    \n\n89 \n\n  \n    \n\nfor the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is \n\ncommunicated to or obtained by the Person serving as an Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  \n\n \n(b)          The Agents and their respective Related Parties shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken \n\nby it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Majority Lenders as the applicable Agent shall believe in good faith \n\nshall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 9.01 and 7.01, or (ii) in the absence of its own \n\n\n\ngross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable \n\njudgment.  \n\n \n(c)          No Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any recital, \n\nstatement, warranty or representation (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with this Agreement or any \n\nother Loan Document or any document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report \n\nor other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or \n\nobservance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the \n\noccurrence of any Default, (iv) the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, sufficiency, transferability, \n\neffectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or \n\ndocument, (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 4 or elsewhere herein or (vi) the preparation, filing \n\nor continuation of any UCC financing statements or other filings intended to perfect security interest in Collateral or \n\nthe correctness of any such financing statements or filings. No Agent shall be under any obligation to any Lender to \n\nascertain or inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this \n\nAgreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Borrower or any other \n\nLoan Party. No Agent shall be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty \n\nregarding the existence, ownership, transferability, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or \n\nperfection of the Collateral Agent’s Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection \n\ntherewith, nor shall any Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion \n\nof the Collateral. No Agent shall have any liability to the Borrower, any other Loan Party, any Lender or any other \n\nPerson for the Borrower’s, any other Loan Party’s or any Lender’s, as the case may be, performance of, or failure to \n\nperform, any of their respective obligations and duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. It is \n\nexpressly acknowledged and agreed that no Agent is guaranteeing performance of or assuming liability for the \n\nobligations of the other parties to the Loan Documents or to the Collateral. No Agent shall be liable for (a) any indirect, \n\nspecial, punitive or consequential damages (including without limitation lost profits) whatsoever, even if it has been \n\ninformed of the likelihood thereof and regardless of the form of  \n\n    \n\n90 \n\n  \n    \n\naction or (b) any losses or delays arising from (i) any causes or acts beyond its control, (ii) any delay, error, omission \n\nor default of any mail, telegraph, cable or wireless agency or operator or (iii) the acts or edicts of any government or \n\ngovernmental agency or other group or entity exercising governmental powers.  \n\n \nSection 8.04.   Reliance by the Agents.  Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in \n\nrelying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype \n\nmessage, statement, order or other document or conversation (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet \n\nwebsite posting or other distribution) reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent \n\nor made by the proper Person or Persons. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the \n\nBorrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not \n\ntaken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. Each Agent may deem and treat \n\nthe payee of any Note delivered hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, \n\nnegotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with such Agent. Each Agent shall be fully justified in failing or \n\nrefusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice \n\nor concurrence of the Majority Lenders and it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any \n\nand all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. \n\nNothing contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall require any Agent to advance or expend its \n\nown funds. Each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement \n\nand the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Majority Lenders and such request and any action \n\ntaken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.  \n\n \nSection 8.05.   Notice of Default.   No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence \n\nof any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless it shall have received notice from a Lender or the Borrower \n\nreferring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of \n\ndefault.” In the event that any Agent receives such a notice, such Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the \n\n\n\nLenders and the other Agent. Each applicable Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of \n\nDefault as shall be reasonably directed by the Majority Lenders; provided that, unless and until such Agent shall have \n\nreceived such directions, such Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such \n\naction, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.  \n\n \nSection 8.06.     Non Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders.   Each Lender expressly acknowledges that no \n\nAgent nor any of its Related Parties has made any  \n\n    \n\n91 \n\n  \n    \n\nrepresentations or warranties to it and that no act by such Agent hereinafter taken, including, without limitation, any \n\nreview of the affairs of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or \n\nwarranty by such Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to each Agent that it has, independently and without \n\nreliance upon such Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed \n\nappropriate, made its own appraisal of an investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other \n\ncondition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties and made its own decision to make its \n\nLoans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without \n\nreliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem \n\nappropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action \n\nunder this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform \n\nitself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and \n\nthe other Loan Parties. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the \n\nLenders by the applicable Agent hereunder or under any other applicable Loan Document, such Agent shall not have \n\nany duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, \n\noperations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any other \n\nLoan Party which may come into the possession of such Agent or any of its Related Parties.  \n\n \nSection 8.07.   Indemnification.   The Lenders will hold harmless and indemnify each Agent in its capacity \n\nas such and each of their respective Affiliates and each of their and their respective Affiliates’ respective officers, \n\ndirectors, employees, managers, managing members, agents, advisors, attorneys and representatives (to the extent not \n\nreimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to the \n\nrespective Loans made by such Lender outstanding on the date on which indemnification is sought, from and against \n\nany and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or \n\ndisbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the \n\npayment of the Loans and including, without limitation, attorneys fees and expenses) be imposed on, incurred by or \n\nasserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, the Loans, the Facility, this \n\nAgreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or \n\nthe transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection \n\nwith any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such Agent’s \n\nliabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting \n\nsolely from such Agent’s gross negligence or willful  \n\n    \n\n92 \n\n  \n    \n\nmisconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment). The agreements \n\nin this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.  \n\n \nSection 8.08.    Agents in Their Individual Capacities.   (a) Each Agent shall have the same rights and powers \n\nunder the Loan Documents, to the extent it is a Lender, as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it \n\nwere not the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” \n\nshall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include such Agent hereunder in \n\nits individual capacity. Each Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from, act as trustee under \n\nindentures of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of \n\n\n\nbusiness with the Borrower, any of its respective Subsidiaries, other Affiliates or any person that may do business \n\nwith or own securities of the Loan Parties or any such Subsidiary or Affiliate, as if such person were not the \n\nAdministrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and \n\nsuch Agent and its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from the Loan Parties and its Affiliates for \n\nservices in connection with the Loan Documents or otherwise, in all cases without any duty to account for the same \n\nto the Lenders.  \n\n \n(b)          Each Lender understands that the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, acting in their \n\nrespective individual capacities, and their respective Affiliates (collectively, an “Agent’s Group”) are engaged in a \n\nwide range of financial services and businesses (including investment management, financing, securities trading, \n\ncorporate and investment banking and research) (such services and businesses are collectively referred to in \n\nthis Section 8.08(b) as “Activities”) and may engage in the Activities with or on behalf of one or more of the Loan \n\nParties or their respective Affiliates. Furthermore, an Agent’s Group may, in undertaking the Activities, engage in \n\ntrading in financial products or undertake other investment businesses for its own account or on behalf of others \n\n(including the Borrower and its Affiliates and including holding, for its own account or on behalf of others, equity, \n\ndebt and similar positions in the Borrower or its Affiliates), including trading in or holding long, short or derivative \n\npositions in securities, loans or other financial products of the Borrower or its Affiliates. Each Lender understands and \n\nagrees that in engaging in the Activities, an Agent’s Group may receive or otherwise obtain information concerning \n\nthe Borrower or its Affiliates (including information concerning the ability of the Borrower to perform its Obligations \n\nhereunder and under the other Loan Documents) which information may not be available to any of the Lenders that \n\nare not members of such Agent’s Group. No Agent nor any member of any Agent’s Group shall have any duty to \n\ndisclose to any Lender or use on behalf of the Lenders, and shall not be liable for the failure to so disclose or use, any \n\ninformation whatsoever about or derived from the Activities or otherwise (including any information concerning  \n\n    \n\n93 \n\n  \n    \n\nthe business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any \n\nAffiliate of the Borrower) or to account for any revenue or profits obtained in connection with the Activities, except \n\nthat each Agent shall deliver or otherwise make available to each Lender such documents as are expressly required by \n\nany Loan Document to be transmitted by such Agent to the Lender.  \n\n \n(c)          Each Lender further understands that there may be situations where members of an Agent’s Group \n\nor their respective customers (including the Borrower and its Affiliates) either now have or may in the future have \n\ninterests or take actions that may conflict with the interests of any one or more of the Lenders (including the interests \n\nof the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents). Each Lender agrees that no member of any Agent’s \n\nGroup is or shall be required to restrict its activities as a result of the Person serving as Administrative Agent and/or \n\nthe Collateral Agent, as applicable, being a member of an Agent’s Group, and that each member of an Agent’s Group \n\nmay undertake any Activities without further consultation with or notification to any Lender.  \n\n \nSection 8.09.    Successor Agent.   Each Agent may resign as Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral \n\nAgent, as applicable, upon 30 days’ written notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. If any Agent shall resign as an \n\nAgent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, then the Majority Lenders shall \n\nappoint a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of such \n\nAgent hereunder; provided that so long as a Default or Event of Default has not occurred and is continuing, the prior \n\nconsent of the Borrower shall be required prior to the appointment of such successor agent; and provided further that \n\nsuch consent from the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Effective upon such appointment and \n\napproval, the term “Administrative Agent” and/or “Collateral Agent,” as applicable, shall mean such successor \n\nagent, and, effective upon the earlier of such appointment and the expiration of such 30 days’ notice, the former \n\nAgent’s rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be terminated, \n\nin either case, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to  this \n\nAgreement or any holders of the Loans. After any retiring Agent’s resignation in such capacity, the provisions of \n\nthis Article 8 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative \n\nAgent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a \n\nparty. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective upon the expiry of the \n\n\n\n30 days’ notice, provided that the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, for purposes of any right of pledge \n\ngoverned by the laws of the Netherlands, including the Dutch CV Pledge, any resignation by the Collateral Agent \n\nshall not be effective with respect to its rights and obligations under the Parallel Debt(s), until such rights and \n\nobligations have been assumed by the successor Collateral Agent. Without  \n\n    \n\n94 \n\n  \n    \n\nprejudice to the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the Collateral Agent will reasonably \n\ncooperate in the assumption of its rights and obligations under or in connection with the Parallel Debt(s) by any such \n\nsuccessor and will reasonably cooperate in transferring to such successor Collateral Agent all rights under the Foreign \n\nPledge Agreement to the extent governed by the laws of the Netherlands.  \n\n \nSection 8.10.   Lenders as Agent.   Upon written notice to the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral \n\nAgent, as applicable, and the Borrower by the Majority Lenders, any provision of the Loan Documents requiring the \n\nconsent or agreement or other approval or action of the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as \n\napplicable, may instead require the consent, agreement or other approval or action of the Majority Lenders; provided, \n\nhowever, for the avoidance of doubt, any such consent, agreement, approval or action which affects the rights or duties \n\nof the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in its capacity as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent shall \n\nrequire the consent of the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable.  \n\n \nArticle 9  \n\nMISCELLANEOUS  \n\n \nSection 9.01.   Amendments and Waivers.   Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document (other than \n\nthe Warrants), nor any terms hereof or thereof may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified, and no consent \n\nmay be granted by the Administrative Agent hereunder, except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing \n\nentered into by the Borrower and the Majority Lenders; provided that no such waiver and no such amendment, \n\nsupplement, modification or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by each Lender adversely affected thereby and \n\nthe Borrower, do any of the following: (i) increase the Commitments of the Lenders or subject the Lenders to any \n\nadditional obligations, (ii) change the principal of, interest on, or currency of, the Loans or any fees or other amounts \n\npayable hereunder (other than waiving the requirement to pay the rate of interest set forth in Section 2.06(b) during \n\nthe continuation of an Event of Default in connection with the waiver of such Event of Default by the Majority \n\nLenders), (iii) postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Loans, any Note delivered \n\nhereunder or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder (other than restoring the schedule for repayment of Loans \n\nto the Maturity Date after issuance of a Notice of Cancellation of Acceleration), (iv) amend the definition of “Majority \n\nLenders”, (v) amend, modify or waive Sections 2.07, 9.10 or 9.11, (vi) consent to the assignment or transfer by any \n\nLoan Party of any of its rights or Loan Obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or (vii) amend \n\nthis Section 9.01; and provided further that no  \n\n \n95 \n\n  \n    \n\namendment, waiver, supplement or modification shall, unless in writing and signed by the applicable Agent, affect \n\nthe rights or duties of any Agent. Further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.02, if \n\nfollowing the Closing Date, the Administrative Agent and any Loan Party shall have jointly identified an obvious \n\nerror or any error or omission of a technical or immaterial nature, in each case, in any provision of the Loan \n\nDocuments, then the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Loan Parties shall be permitted to amend \n\nsuch provision and such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party \n\nto any Loan Documents if the same is not objected to in writing by the Majority Lenders within five (5) Business Days \n\nfollowing receipt of notice thereof.  \n\n \nSection 9.02.   Communications.   All notices and other communications shall be in writing and shall be \n\ndelivered by hand or overnight courier service, facsimile (or other electronic communication) or mailed by certified \n\nor registered first class mail. Each such notice or communication shall be delivered to the relevant party at the facsimile \n\n\n\nnumber or address (including e-mail address), and marked for the attention of the person(s), from time to time specified \n\nin a written notice by that party to the other parties for such purpose. The initial information for the Lenders is as set \n\nforth in Schedule II. The initial information for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent is as set forth in \n\nSchedule 9.02. All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions of \n\nthis Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt.  \n\n \nAll notices and communications delivered hereunder shall, unless submitted in the English language, be \n\naccompanied by a certified English translation thereof, which certified English translation shall (except in the case of \n\nlaws, regulations or official determinations of any Governmental Authority) be controlling absent manifest error in \n\nthe case of doubt as to the proper interpretation or construction of the document which it purports to translate.  \n\n \nThe Borrower hereby acknowledges that (a) the Administrative Agent will make available to the Lenders \n\nmaterials and/or information provided by or on behalf of the Borrower hereunder (collectively, the “Borrower \n\nMaterials”) by posting the Borrower Materials on Intralinks, Syndtrak or another similar electronic system (the \n\n“Platform”) and (b) certain of the Lenders may be “public-side” Lenders (i.e., Lenders that do not wish to receive \n\nmaterial non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities) (each, a “Public Lender”). The \n\nBorrower, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, hereby agrees that (w) all Borrower Materials that are to be made \n\navailable to Public Lenders shall be clearly and conspicuously marked “PUBLIC” which, at a minimum, shall mean \n\nthat the word “PUBLIC” shall appear prominently on the first page thereof; (x) by marking Borrower Materials \n\n“PUBLIC,” the Borrower shall be deemed to have authorized the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to treat such \n\nBorrower  \n\n    \n\n96 \n\n  \n    \n\nMaterials as not containing any material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities for \n\npurposes of United States federal and state securities laws (provided, however, that to the extent such Borrower \n\nMaterials constitute information received from the Borrower or its Subsidiaries and related to the Borrower, its \n\nSubsidiaries or their respective businesses, other than any such information that was available to the Administrative \n\nAgent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to its disclosure by the Borrower or such \n\nSubsidiary, they shall be treated as set forth in Section 9.12); (y) all Borrower Materials marked “PUBLIC” are \n\npermitted to be made available through a portion of the Platform designated as “Public Investor” (or with a similar \n\ndesignation); and (z) the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to treat any Borrower Materials that are not marked \n\n“PUBLIC” as being suitable only for posting on a portion of the Platform not marked as “Public Investor” (or with a \n\nsimilar designation).
